Episode 240 is a wide-ranging catch-up that turns into a love letter to “running Bitcoin.” McIntosh and Kenshin swap life updates (including Kenshin’s push to launch a new project and McIntosh’s experiments with ChatGPT/Codex), then McIntosh shares a big workflow win: an automated script that pulls episode data straight from the RSS feed to generate the show’s episode pages—turning a manual, repetitive task into a quick, repeatable process.

From there, the conversation pivots into Bitcoin history and self-sovereignty, using Hal Finney’s famous “Running Bitcoin” post as the jumping-off point. They break down why nodes matter, what it means to run one (including Bitcoin Core vs. Knots, Electrum indexing, and Tor vs. clearnet), and compare their own setups—StartOS, DIY server setups, and newer projects like Nirvati/Yantra. They close with news and notes on Europe’s push toward a digital euro and tightening “travel rule” compliance, plus examples of Bitcoin and decentralized communication tools being used amid censorship and unrest—reinforcing the episode’s core theme: running your own infrastructure is how you reclaim privacy, resilience, and freedom.
