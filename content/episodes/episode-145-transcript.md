00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.779
McIntosh: Hey, Sat Stackers. Today is November 19th, and this is episode 145 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, McIntosh. And today's episode

2
00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:09.945
is did Argentina

3
00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:10.825
win?

4
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.625
Alright. We're gonna do the market update, and we are going to

5
00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:46.705
talk about

6
00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:47.585
Argentina

7
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:48.465
today.

8
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.640
A few other things as well. We're gonna talk about our supporters,

9
00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.879
little bit of news,

10
00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.199
and

11
00:00:58.315 --> 00:00:59.295
call it a day.

12
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.655
It's been a week since I last talked to you.

13
00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:06.895
Dear listeners, and thank you for being patient. I did not record on Thursday.

14
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.750
Just life, you know, just too busy,

15
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.950
to be honest.

16
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.590
And, shame on me. I guess that shouldn't be the case, but,

17
00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:19.695
but it was. It was more or less work

18
00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:21.615
related all day long,

19
00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.935
from morning until late at night and

20
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.500
and Wednesday night as well. I do normally on Wednesdays record and then put it out on Thursdays, but,

21
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:38.795
sometimes I record on Thursdays and put it out on Thursdays. Did not make either one. So, again, I apologize.

22
00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:40.475
Market update.

23
00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:41.595
Well,

24
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.200
If I go back to what I talked about a week ago,

25
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.280
what did I say?

26
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.920
I said,

27
00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:53.104
something to the effect of

28
00:01:54.445 --> 00:02:03.340
I really thought it looked like it was going to go lower, but it really wants to go higher, if that makes sense. Just kind of the way that

29
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.820
I don't know. At some point, maybe you kinda get a feel for this. I don't know.

30
00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:12.295
But with as much activity as we had had,

31
00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:15.815
even as bullish as the charts had been,

32
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330
it was time for a pullback, and we got that.

33
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.610
So if we go back 7 days let me adjust my chart real quick.

34
00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.255
I do know the weekly closed last week,

35
00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:30.295
which I

36
00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:32.695
we reported on last episode was 37,000

37
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.260
and seventy. So

38
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.260
we have our market now

39
00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.739
of what? 37347.

40
00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.975
So, basically, it was, like, $300 higher right now, but that doesn't tell the whole story.

41
00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:50.295
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Right.

42
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.420
So we dropped

43
00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:09.925
yeah. So Sunday wasn't too bad, but we were basically at our high when we open not too far below it. We went, like, a pop couple 100 up, and then we fell. And then Monday, we dropped. Tuesday, we dropped all the way down to 34

44
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.490
is in 600 nope. 34,700.

45
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.050
I'll get it right in a minute. 34, yeah, 34782,

46
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.530
somewhere around 34,800

47
00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:21.335
Unknown: 800.

48
00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:23.735
And then the next day,

49
00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:25.575
so we're talking about Wednesday,

50
00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:27.335
we went

51
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.099
all the way up

52
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.379
to 37985.

53
00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.220
We touched 38,000,

54
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.605
McIntosh: and then we went right back down. It was it's been a roller coaster of a week, really,

55
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:38.805
but

56
00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:44.885
we've come right back up over the last 1, 2, 3 days. Now we're opening the 4th day.

57
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.109
So we're right back where we started.

58
00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.030
And I was pulling back a little bit, of course,

59
00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:52.549
looking

60
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.150
at the overall patterns

61
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:58.385
And what I'm seeing come apart come about right now

62
00:03:59.245 --> 00:03:59.745
is

63
00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.745
a ascending channel.

64
00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:06.230
So you've got basically 2 lines that are parallel to each other that

65
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.470
are going ascending. You're getting higher highs and

66
00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:17.014
lower lower highs. Yes. That makes sense. Higher highs and lower highs as well. So

67
00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:18.875
and it's in this

68
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.960
kind of upward angle.

69
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.280
This is a bullish pattern.

70
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.479
Normally, we would break

71
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.319
upwards out of this.

72
00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:32.875
And what we are doing and what we have been doing, in fact,

73
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.235
for the last

74
00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:35.595
roughly

75
00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:37.514
21 days,

76
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.150
not 21, almost a full month. October 24th is kind of when this pattern started.

77
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.414
Unknown: So 3 day 4 day 4 or 5 days from being

78
00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:50.414
a full month,

79
00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:53.535
McIntosh: we've been in this bullish pattern. The expectation

80
00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:54.815
would be ultimately,

81
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.370
we broke

82
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.970
high. Now what we saw last week and what I was describing,

83
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.170
we've we've had so much bullish upward.

84
00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:10.155
Yes, we did fall for 1, 2, 3, 4 days in a row, then we had a nice green day, and then we fell again.

85
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.570
So we did we've kind of released some of that pressure, if you wanna call it that.

86
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.250
Now that's all fuzzy and whatever. You can call it whatever you want,

87
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:22.885
But the reality is we are staying in these upward channels.

88
00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:24.325
The

89
00:05:25.105 --> 00:05:35.520
lines of these upward channels. We've actually gone a little higher in a couple of, it's not perfectly clean if I were to take a screenshot of this and post it. It's not textbook,

90
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.400
but

91
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:38.225
it is actually

92
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:41.425
breaking on the high side, not the low side,

93
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.025
if that makes sense.

94
00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:49.539
So it is a very bullish indicator to me. So I do think we're gonna end up going higher.

95
00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.675
I could see us heading on up to, ultimately to $40,000,

96
00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.075
and then we'll see what happens there.

97
00:05:56.935 --> 00:05:58.955
So we may be testing that level

98
00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:00.235
here shortly.

99
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.170
If you look at the weekly patterns, we've had 1,

100
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.770
Unknown: 2, 3, 4 weeks in a row now.

101
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.505
Solid green.

102
00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:12.525
So that actually goes back, yeah, to that,

103
00:06:14.525 --> 00:06:18.850
McIntosh: October 23rd. If you wanna go back no. Actually, we've had 5 weeks I apologize.

104
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.210
Unknown: Going all the way back to October 16th,

105
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.570
we're opening our 6th week.

106
00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:29.505
It will remain to be seen. Will it be green or red?

107
00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:30.465
I

108
00:06:31.885 --> 00:06:35.105
believe we will have a small pause here.

109
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.210
I

110
00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:37.569
McIntosh: so

111
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.889
to be clear, I know this can be confusing.

112
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.169
Unknown: We're near the top of the ascending

113
00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:44.995
channel.

114
00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:47.795
McIntosh: The top right now would be right about 38,000.

115
00:06:48.415 --> 00:06:53.130
So we're like 700. I think it will probably go up touch that, and then it will come back

116
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.190
Unknown: down to roughly 36,000

117
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.070
McIntosh: because we've had 5 weeks in a row

118
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:04.915
of upward movement. It's going to at some point.

119
00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:09.795
We're we're not just going to march eternally upward, but I do think we will

120
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.400
kind of pull back and consolidate on the lower part of this.

121
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.065
The good news is, listener, you don't have to worry about anything that I just said,

122
00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:22.145
it may or may not come true.

123
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.665
As we always say here on generation Bitcoin, I know y'all

124
00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:37.199
you boost it if you if you like this part of the show or if you don't like it. I don't you know? I'm seeking listener feedback, not criticism or whatever. Just just say.

125
00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:44.515
If you really don't care for this part, if you don't find this interesting, then let me know. If you do,

126
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.669
I will try and make it more concise, but we'll we'll continue to do it more.

127
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.710
I enjoy at least looking at these and trying to figure it out and understand.

128
00:07:55.335 --> 00:08:01.355
Maybe give me an idea of where things might go. But, of course, we always talk here about DCA. You should be

129
00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:04.795
adding to your stack daily, if at all possible,

130
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.660
of Bitcoin. Don't worry about the price. Don't worry about if we break 40,000 or 38,000

131
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.860
or 39,000

132
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.035
or if we drop to 35,000 or

133
00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:20.355
or whatever. You know? This week, we dropped down to 36,000

134
00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:22.200
excuse excuse me, 34,800,

135
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.120
like I said, would have been a great opportunity to buy,

136
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:34.904
of course, but do you know that that's gonna be no. You don't know. Don't worry about it. Just buy. If you think it's pretty low,

137
00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:36.665
buy double if you can.

138
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.560
Just keep doing it. That's

139
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.400
that's it. The long term DCA are the ones

140
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.560
statistically who win

141
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.945
in this game, if you wanna call it a game.

142
00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:50.585
So there you go. In addition,

143
00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:51.945
of course,

144
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.360
let's take a look at our time,

145
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.720
our calendar,

146
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.519
our blockchain statistics. We are at

147
00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:03.025
817,565

148
00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:04.465
as we record,

149
00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:11.265
which ironically is 10 blocks more than 1000

150
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.620
from the last time. So in other words, we were 816-555

151
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.980
last time if I'm not mistaken.

152
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.715
Our transaction fees are still very high. Gonna return to that in just a second.

153
00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:25.875
Our difficulty adjustment

154
00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:29.075
or our our last adjustment was 3.55%.

155
00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:31.395
That was on November 12th.

156
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:41.060
And our next adjustment right now is looking like it's gonna be around 2%. As I record this, it's 2.41

157
00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:42.205
%,

158
00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:48.285
Unknown: but we will see. But, again, looking at an upward adjustment.

159
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.300
Now let's talk about

160
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.339
McIntosh: fees. Fees are about to drive me crazy. They're still

161
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.100
very high. Our mempool

162
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.460
is filled overflowing. It's actually at one point

163
00:09:58.835 --> 00:09:59.975
3 5 gigabytes

164
00:10:00.355 --> 00:10:01.495
as I speak,

165
00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:06.375
and the fees themselves have been very high. Now as a miner,

166
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:07.490
of course,

167
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:09.730
this is a very good thing.

168
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.050
It's been profitable when we've been mining blocks this week.

169
00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:18.575
Had a couple of slow days here, but prior to that, we've done okay.

170
00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:24.180
But right now, a low priority transaction is a 129 sats per v byte. That's

171
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.960
6 point,

172
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.160
$746.74,

173
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.240
a 168

174
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.405
sats per v byte for a medium priority and then 2.22

175
00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:38.605
for a high priority, and that's $11.61.

176
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.750
So we're quite high, and we've been high.

177
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:52.834
And it very rarely fluctuates downward. I've got some things, frankly, I need to do on chain, and I'm starting to begin to wonder

178
00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:54.595
if I'm going to have to

179
00:10:55.455 --> 00:11:01.550
just do it and pay the fees. I keep hoping that these stupid ordinals would run out

180
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.470
and fee activity

181
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.110
would drop lower. There's

182
00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:08.005
high fees

183
00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:11.764
going on right now, and these may continue for a long time.

184
00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:16.485
One of the things we probably need to talk about before we wrap up for the year

185
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.150
on November 30th

186
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.430
will be

187
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.350
Unknown: kind of ways that we could avoid this, and, unfortunately, it's not

188
00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:25.245
easy or,

189
00:11:26.024 --> 00:11:32.524
McIntosh: you know, ideal or whatever, but maybe there are some things that you can do to save some money

190
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.650
if you're dealing with on chain.

191
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.970
So maybe we should talk about that.

192
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.450
But just to give you an idea of that's what's going on. So what's our topic?

193
00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:43.454
Did Argentina win?

194
00:11:44.394 --> 00:11:50.574
Macintosh, what are you talking about? Well, many of you probably know. I've talked about it a number of times off and on.

195
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.100
The Argentina

196
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.980
primary

197
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.259
election was today, and they do have a winner, and I will announce that in just a second.

198
00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:00.315
And that's what we're gonna talk about.

199
00:12:00.694 --> 00:12:02.875
But we've had people on from Argentina.

200
00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:08.315
We've talked about the Argentina election, then we've kinda did a live thing

201
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.580
during the last round,

202
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.620
I gave the results as I recorded, and then I think I pushed out right after that.

203
00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:21.675
And tonight, I'm actually going to push this out as well as as soon as I get it done and edited.

204
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.010
But, I did wanna let you know,

205
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:31.324
it was official that Javier Milei did win the election earlier today,

206
00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:32.445
the

207
00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:36.204
person who was running against him did concede,

208
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.810
And, Javier will be taking office. I do not know when that takes place.

209
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.825
As I have stated, and I continue to stand by this. Argentina

210
00:12:47.365 --> 00:12:47.865
needs

211
00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:48.825
change.

212
00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:51.465
I do not know

213
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.690
Javier is the answer,

214
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.290
but at least they're trying something different.

215
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.010
We'll talk about that for a few minutes,

216
00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:02.375
Then we'll talk about our supporters,

217
00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:03.894
talk about the news,

218
00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:06.535
what news there was outside of this,

219
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.855
and then we'll wrap things up.

220
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.670
So Argentina.

221
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.190
So one of the,

222
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.310
resources that I will be linking to in the show notes is an article

223
00:13:18.834 --> 00:13:19.654
from CNN,

224
00:13:20.355 --> 00:13:22.295
just to give you an idea. Now

225
00:13:22.675 --> 00:13:23.175
Unknown: Javier,

226
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:24.295
is

227
00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:25.815
so called

228
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.960
McIntosh: right wing, if you wanna call it that.

229
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:35
He is he considers himself a libertarian. He probably is a libertarian by virtually anyone's definition.

230
00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:38.564
By the way, this is showing that he won

231
00:13:39.024 --> 00:13:41.365
more than 94% of the votes have been counted,

232
00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:44.564
Unknown: over 55% of the votes. 13

233
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.610
0.781,000,000

234
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:47.690
votes.

235
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:59.965
McIntosh: So he had a clear victory. It was actually closer than I thought it would be. I honestly thought most of I thought it'd be 60, 65%. And the reason why I say that,

236
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.850
the person who dropped out of the last round who was forced and I apologize.

237
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.315
I do not remember. It was Barbara something, if I'm not mistaken, but I don't remember her last name.

238
00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:12.435
Anyways,

239
00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:14.515
she was more

240
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:15.715
right leaning

241
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:17.950
then

242
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:18.830
the

243
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:19.710
minister,

244
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.150
Sergio Masa, that he defeated.

245
00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:26.004
I figured that those voters would essentially

246
00:14:26.545 --> 00:14:31.444
move over to Javier, and certainly some of them did. A lot of them did.

247
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.110
But I thought it would be even more of a convincing victory if you wanna call it that.

248
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:44.335
This is not the article I was looking at. Let me pull that up real quick. I wanted to point out a couple of things in this article.

249
00:14:45.435 --> 00:14:46.495
Unknown: I thought it was

250
00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:47.775
pretty crazy.

251
00:14:48.475 --> 00:14:52.660
McIntosh: I don't know if you are right leaning or left leaning,

252
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.300
I try and stay out of this stuff

253
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.820
or middle of the road so called or or whatever.

254
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.964
They have flat updated this.

255
00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:03.524
The link to the article

256
00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:09.204
Alright. Well, I'll try and summarize what I saw. Unfortunately, this means that I,

257
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.300
well, I'll tell you what I saw. Journalism,

258
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.060
in my opinion,

259
00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:17.635
mainstream journalism

260
00:15:18.655 --> 00:15:19.875
is virtually dead.

261
00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:21.555
There's

262
00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:22.995
mostly regurgitation

263
00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:28.750
of other news sources, this kind of thing, you'll see a lot of Reuters news articles,

264
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.830
this kind of thing being

265
00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:32.445
Unknown: just redistributed

266
00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:33.325
by

267
00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:36.445
Fox, CNN, whoever it is.

268
00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:38.045
And, unfortunately,

269
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:45.329
McIntosh: with the majority of these news sources, they will either lean right or they will lean left and typically,

270
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.370
very much one way or the other.

271
00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:51.425
Unknown: They do not take the time to dissect anything,

272
00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:58.620
McIntosh: or even have an understanding really, especially if it doesn't meet their worldview.

273
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.860
So CNN certainly

274
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.885
would be a left leaning organization. They're probably a little less than they used to be, to be honest, but they're still very left leaning.

275
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:11.084
And they have been very careful

276
00:16:11.464 --> 00:16:12.205
in every

277
00:16:12.584 --> 00:16:14.605
article that they posted about Javier

278
00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:17.700
he is a far right outsider.

279
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.779
So, you know, they wanna make him sound like he's this radical,

280
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.180
you know, far right.

281
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:27.014
I don't know what that makes you Hitler,

282
00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:28.055
I guess.

283
00:16:29.235 --> 00:16:32.280
What's the word? It's not communist. It's left,

284
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.040
right would fascist.

285
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.360
Fascist, I think, is the proper terminology political terminology.

286
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.600
Unknown: Now

287
00:16:41.045 --> 00:16:42.425
I do not live in Argentina.

288
00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:45.225
McIntosh: I am gonna give my opinion on this,

289
00:16:46.084 --> 00:16:48.824
as an outsider, as someone who does not speak Spanish.

290
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.560
And so there are things that sometimes I just don't understand,

291
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.560
Unknown: but

292
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.680
he's not a far right

293
00:16:58.024 --> 00:17:00.204
Canada. He is a libertarian,

294
00:17:01.225 --> 00:17:04.284
and that brings a worldview if you wanna call it that.

295
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11.460
McIntosh: But he's not a fascist. He's not let me look this up because I'm almost I I don't wanna be misspeaking.

296
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:20.289
Yes. That is the correct.

297
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.090
And I think they do that. So the definition,

298
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.889
literally, I'm I'm just gonna from Wikipedia.

299
00:17:27.565 --> 00:17:29.905
Fascism is a far right authoritarian

300
00:17:30.205 --> 00:17:30.705
ultranationalist

301
00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:34.385
political ideology and movement characterized by a

302
00:17:34.685 --> 00:17:35.905
dictatorial leader,

303
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.799
centralized autocracy,

304
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.080
militarism,

305
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.799
forcible suppression of opposition,

306
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.960
belief in natural social

307
00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:44.919
hierarchy,

308
00:17:45.745 --> 00:17:46.245
subordination

309
00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:50.725
of individual interest for the for the perceived. I'm not even gonna keep reading.

310
00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:55.365
I'd have to click through and whatever, but it I think you get the idea.

311
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.950
I think they do this on purpose.

312
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.110
He's not a fascist.

313
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:08.835
He is a libertarian from everything that I understand, And I may not agree with everything that he says and probably won't.

314
00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:12.035
In fact, undoubtedly, I won't,

315
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.680
but I don't think that's very fair.

316
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.160
And they also completely misrepresented

317
00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:22.365
the

318
00:18:23.465 --> 00:18:30.605
inflation data. See, now this is what they've updated. Now maybe they just made a mistake, but they seem to make lots of mistakes like this.

319
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.190
Unknown: They said something along

320
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.549
McIntosh: the effects of,

321
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.990
inflation was a 144%

322
00:18:40.505 --> 00:18:43.325
or something along those lines. But it's now down

323
00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:45.245
from that high

324
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.340
Unknown: by, like, 30 points.

325
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.260
And that's

326
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.060
absolutely

327
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.100
categorically

328
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.940
McIntosh: not true and took me, like, three minutes to verify.

329
00:18:56.775 --> 00:19:01.275
Unknown: So I have a link in the show notes to tradingeconomics.com,

330
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.970
McIntosh: which I find to be a reputable website

331
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.865
on the inflation data for Argentina, And it very clearly shows what I absolutely

332
00:19:14.245 --> 00:19:14.745
remember

333
00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:16.505
that in September,

334
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.919
the inflation was a 138.3%,

335
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.840
technically.

336
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.840
And in October,

337
00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.200
it was 142

338
00:19:26.184 --> 00:19:26.684
0.7%.

339
00:19:27.225 --> 00:19:29.165
If I showed you this chart

340
00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:32.445
going all the way back to December

341
00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.565
November 1 year ago well, that makes sense.

342
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.090
It started at 92%

343
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.370
in November.

344
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.410
92.4.

345
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.250
It's now at 142.7.

346
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.485
It is literally straight up except July

347
00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:48.405
when it dipped from 115.6

348
00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:51.045
to 113.4,

349
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.125
and then the next month in August went up to 124

350
00:19:55.809 --> 00:19:56.470
point four.

351
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.870
So that fabrication

352
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.710
was a complete lie.

353
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.070
Unknown: It was a complete

354
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.870
non truth. I'm not gonna say they were lying

355
00:20:05.745 --> 00:20:06.885
certainly on purpose.

356
00:20:07.985 --> 00:20:09.605
If if you're lying, you

357
00:20:10.225 --> 00:20:14.960
well, you're doing that to mislead people. They may have just been stupid.

358
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:15.840
Excuse

359
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.280
me. But,

360
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.560
McIntosh: you know, it's a really simple thing to verify,

361
00:20:21.765 --> 00:20:24.105
And it's a very important point of

362
00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:24.905
Javier's

363
00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:25.785
candidacy.

364
00:20:26.405 --> 00:20:27.145
This was

365
00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:32.700
the center of his candidacy. See, what is causing this? The Central Bank

366
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.220
of Argentina

367
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.380
printing money out of control,

368
00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:38.995
taking loans with the IMF, the

369
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:42.755
economic policies of Argentina.

370
00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:48.880
Unknown: Now, again, this, I'm an outsider. Again, I do not speak Spanish. Again, I know that

371
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.875
colors my view, But this was his

372
00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:56.235
McIntosh: from everything that I can tell, this was like his core thing,

373
00:20:56.535 --> 00:21:05.500
and he is going to go in there. I put this on Twitter. I post he's going to go in there, and he's going to strip out a large number of governmental institutions.

374
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.340
And you are going to hear

375
00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:10.925
caterwauling like you've never heard before

376
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:12.765
if you're paying attention

377
00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:15.565
of people, of governmental officials,

378
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.059
of busy bodies of

379
00:21:18.679 --> 00:21:20.700
probably a lot of media people in Argentina

380
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:21.900
crying

381
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.340
that he's shutting down this ministry and that ministry.

382
00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:28.404
And he's trying to save the country,

383
00:21:29.024 --> 00:21:29.924
in my opinion.

384
00:21:30.784 --> 00:21:35.044
So I wish him luck. I do. I truly do, and I mean that.

385
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.640
I know that he has announced

386
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.240
that he will be

387
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.480
dollarizing

388
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:50.245
the Peso. And I wanna make sure I get this correct. I I'm just gonna say I'm not sure because I've gone back and forth on this. I've been corrected,

389
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:53.490
and I can't remember what the correction was.

390
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.769
I believe

391
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.250
that means that the peso

392
00:21:59.365 --> 00:22:02.745
Unknown: will be removed, and they will start using US dollars.

393
00:22:03.684 --> 00:22:04.825
It could mean

394
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.640
that the peso will be pegged to the dollar.

395
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.519
McIntosh: Either way,

396
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.360
they're tying themselves

397
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.200
to the United States

398
00:22:16.075 --> 00:22:20.415
in terms of economic policy, in terms of a stable currency

399
00:22:21.915 --> 00:22:24.015
Unknown: to try and control inflation. Now

400
00:22:24.399 --> 00:22:26.500
McIntosh: that may be a good short term view.

401
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:29.299
We have inflation here in the United States.

402
00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:33.380
Our inflation may get worse over time. I believe it will.

403
00:22:34.435 --> 00:22:39.095
Long term, this is probably not the best thing to do. However, when you're at a 142.7%

404
00:22:40.915 --> 00:22:41.415
inflation,

405
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.980
the house is on fire. You do what you have to do, and that would be a good move at least maybe for the next few years.

406
00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:54.315
I believe he has said he will abolish the central bank. I have no problem with that.

407
00:22:55.255 --> 00:22:55.755
Jefferson,

408
00:22:56.455 --> 00:22:58.715
one of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson,

409
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.660
was very adamant that we should never have a government run bank.

410
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.075
There's a quote about that, famous quote that floats around. I keep intending to actually do

411
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:14.595
an episode on that, and maybe one day I will. So I won't go into that, but central banks are,

412
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.380
in my mind, they're not a good thing. So,

413
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.100
anyways, not to elaborate on that.

414
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.820
He has said he will do that. He has

415
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:32.055
he will go in and rip out a bunch of governmental agencies. I'm sure he will. Will there will everything be perfect? Absolutely not. Is he pro Bitcoin?

416
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.670
Seems to be,

417
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.990
we don't know where that's gonna go. Will he eventually move them to a Bitcoin standard? I would love it if he did,

418
00:23:40.425 --> 00:23:47.405
much like El Salvador, I do not know if that will happen. Has he gotten involved in other things certainly in the past?

419
00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:48.365
Absolutely,

420
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:49.405
yes.

421
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.500
So we know, historically, he's not been Bitcoin only.

422
00:23:53.800 --> 00:24:03.294
It remains to be seen what that actually means. I would love to believe and if I were to sit down with, mister Milley president Milley

423
00:24:03.674 --> 00:24:05.455
and say, mister Milley,

424
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:11.870
president Malay, I apologize. I don't speak to such fancy people, so I don't I don't know all the niceties. I'm sorry.

425
00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:14.085
President Milei,

426
00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:20.500
you know, are are you a a Bitcoin Max here? Are you a Bitcoin only guy? Maybe that's a better way to say it.

427
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.840
Well, yes. Okay. Great.

428
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.840
Unknown: Here's what I don't see, the libertarian might say, well, we should just let all these compete,

429
00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:32.575
and that's probably his viewpoint or it was.

430
00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:34.735
We've seen that.

431
00:24:36.315 --> 00:24:38.575
Bitcoin is the only one that has any long term

432
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.480
longevity.

433
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.159
McIntosh: Heath, it's done okay.

434
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.679
It's been around for a while. I don't think it's long for,

435
00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:49.745
Unknown: I think ten years from now, it'll be gone personally,

436
00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:57.130
for various reasons. That would be the libertarian argument. We're just gonna let those play out. Well,

437
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.210
I don't want people to get hurt.

438
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.855
McIntosh: Besides, it's make it's difficult to make a theory of work as a

439
00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:06.355
governmental currency, but, anyways,

440
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.835
not to get off and all that.

441
00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:09.875
So

442
00:25:10.415 --> 00:25:20.990
we will see how Argentina handles this. It is a step, which is good. It is a break from what they've done for a long time, which is probably a really good thing.

443
00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:22.285
I

444
00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:24.445
do hope that Argentina

445
00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.885
starts to turn around.

446
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.649
I would love to see Argentina be like El Salvador.

447
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.450
Be on some Bitcoin standard,

448
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.210
Bitcoin friendly,

449
00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:40.554
friendly for Bitcoin investors,

450
00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:43.595
friendly for people who want to move there,

451
00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:47.035
Unknown: because of Bitcoin laws there,

452
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.360
tapping

453
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.640
their massive,

454
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.640
massive

455
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.640
hydropower resources

456
00:25:54.634 --> 00:25:55.855
for Bitcoin mining.

457
00:25:56.235 --> 00:26:01.134
To Bitfarms, I know, for example, this will be something I will be following closely.

458
00:26:01.754 --> 00:26:03.375
McIntosh: I do own stock in Bitfarms.

459
00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:07.840
They recently announced. They agreed,

460
00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:10.320
made an agreement with the Argentinian

461
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.080
government or the

462
00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:14.685
energy company that runs

463
00:26:14.985 --> 00:26:16.445
which is a governmental

464
00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:18.685
run agency, if I'm not mistaken.

465
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.419
For the next 6 months

466
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.899
during their wet season, I guess, and if I got that wrong, I'm sorry.

467
00:26:27.675 --> 00:26:31.855
It's I do know it's summer down there, which I don't know why that'd be the wet season.

468
00:26:32.235 --> 00:26:34.895
But, anyways, it's the cheaper time, I guess.

469
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.010
They've negotiated

470
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.650
I think it was 2¢ per kilowatt,

471
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:50.125
power, which is incredible. I mean, I I would just die if I had that kind of power. I'd just die and go to heaven. Just be like, I'm done. I can't get any cheaper power than that.

472
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.700
Unknown: Anyways,

473
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.500
they've got a lot of work to do.

474
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.700
They do.

475
00:26:58.015 --> 00:27:05.075
McIntosh: It will be interesting watching them over the next few years. I do hope to make it there. Of course, I hope to make it a lot of places. So me just saying that,

476
00:27:05.455 --> 00:27:06.510
maybe not the

477
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.490
best indicator that I'm going to go there.

478
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.010
Unknown: I'd love to go into Buenos Aires. I'd love to go up into the,

479
00:27:16.035 --> 00:27:18.215
Patagonian area, lower down.

480
00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:22.855
I'd love to spend time even on the, Andean

481
00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:23.895
mountains

482
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:26.020
there, the Andes,

483
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.900
between Chile

484
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.020
and Argentina, maybe jump over into,

485
00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:34.895
McIntosh: the area that goes down into Santiago,

486
00:27:35.835 --> 00:27:39.375
there's some really interesting places here that I would love to see.

487
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.120
To be honest,

488
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.200
just being truthful.

489
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:53.005
It will not be this year. It will not be next year. I've got other plans for next year, but maybe maybe down the road.

490
00:27:53.785 --> 00:27:57.405
And if they really start to turn things around, then, you know,

491
00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.400
maybe at some point down the road, there's some investment

492
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.675
there. It would be great. I would love to see that country grow.

493
00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:07.175
So,

494
00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:14.375
Macintosh, why are you doing this? Why are you talking about other countries again? You do this. You go off. You talk about this. Talk about that.

495
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.400
Unknown: Why?

496
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.480
McIntosh: Good question.

497
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.160
 I'm glad you thought of it.

498
00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.215
Unknown: Here's the answer.

499
00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:27.535
It's important because

500
00:28:29.035 --> 00:28:33.549
McIntosh: I know that the 100 and however many odds, 60 or 90

501
00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.630
Unknown: odd countries in the world

502
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.630
cannot continue

503
00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:40.350
the way that they are. They cannot

504
00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:41.875
mathematically,

505
00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:43.875
socially.

506
00:28:45.775 --> 00:28:50.550
McIntosh: And by mathematically, I mean, the amount of debt that they have. United States, a 125%

507
00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.630
whatever debt to GDP.

508
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.030
Bank, bank.

509
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.310
Japan,

510
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.825
worse, you know, so on and so forth.

511
00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:05.804
That can't continue. Socially, the countries there are so many countries in the world

512
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.220
Unknown: right now,

513
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.460
that are tearing themselves apart.

514
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.659
McIntosh: There has to be a change, and it's either going to get a lot worse

515
00:29:15.255 --> 00:29:16.875
and then get better possibly,

516
00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:21.835
or it's going to get a lot worse and then get even worse or it's going to get better.

517
00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:25.990
Does that make sense? I think that's kind of the three outcomes.

518
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.870
Countries

519
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:29.990
like

520
00:29:30.855 --> 00:29:31.355
Argentina.

521
00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:33.115
Countries

522
00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:34.875
like El Salvador

523
00:29:35.414 --> 00:29:36.794
can lead the way,

524
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.809
and they can show the world, the United States, Russia, Canada,

525
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.049
Western Europe,

526
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.850
whoever.

527
00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:47.075
This is working.

528
00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:49.075
You,

529
00:29:49.775 --> 00:29:51.715
whoever you country your country,

530
00:29:52.495 --> 00:29:55.010
will have to make a change. How are they going to do that?

531
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.630
Are they going to become more disruptive and fight with other countries over resources

532
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:02.790
and

533
00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:05.885
strip more money from their citizens

534
00:30:06.424 --> 00:30:07.804
and cause more

535
00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:10.525
chaos by the I mean,

536
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.990
the banks are starting to close down accounts if you're talking about

537
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.190
crypto. I mean, it's just

538
00:30:18.774 --> 00:30:19.434
the insanity

539
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.914
is is like ratcheting up,

540
00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:26.235
Unknown: and I don't think we're making it up. I think this stuff is going on.

541
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.050
It has to change.

542
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.410
So the reason why I talk about these countries

543
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.650
that I have hoped for

544
00:30:35.174 --> 00:30:37.595
is because I want them to lead the way.

545
00:30:38.855 --> 00:30:39.915
Not only that,

546
00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:42.554
these are countries now, Argentina.

547
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.009
Yes, Argentina has had a lot of inflation,

548
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:51.210
McIntosh: but there was a time when Buenos Aires was considered to be the Paris of

549
00:30:51.775 --> 00:30:52.355
of the,

550
00:30:53.295 --> 00:30:55.555
whichever direction it is, of the east

551
00:30:55.935 --> 00:30:57.315
of, to the east.

552
00:30:58.095 --> 00:31:02.620
Not saying that right. Certainly of Latin America. How about that? We'll go with that.

553
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.660
It was a beautiful city. Not that it is not now, but, you know, it was

554
00:31:08.095 --> 00:31:08.975
cultured. It was

555
00:31:10.495 --> 00:31:16.995
there was so much economic activity going on. It was prosperous. That's the word I'm trying to say,

556
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.870
Unknown: and it's not right now.

557
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.030
It can become that again. Wow. We just printed two blocks.

558
00:31:25.055 --> 00:31:27.235
You've got to be kidding me. That's crazy.

559
00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:28.675
So

560
00:31:29.295 --> 00:31:29.795
817,5

561
00:31:30.415 --> 00:31:30.915
69

562
00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:34.480
was a minute ago, and then, like, just now,

563
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:35.680
817,570.

564
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.560
McIntosh: So we printed, like, three blocks in three minutes.

565
00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:46.045
That's that's a lot. That's kinda weird.

566
00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:51.340
Hey. With statistics, that's the way it works out. Remember, this is not locked to ten minutes, it's

567
00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:57.100
there's well, solving a puzzle is not the right way to put it, but, anyways,

568
00:31:57.865 --> 00:32:00.445
it's just chance, so these things happen.

569
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:02.765
I wonder if

570
00:32:03.305 --> 00:32:06.470
brains mind any of those. Excuse me for just a second.

571
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.150
Gonna jump on

572
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:09.510
and take a look

573
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.430
because I can't help myself.

574
00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:16.505
I need, like, an app that every time I get a block, it just kinda beeps me.

575
00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:17.625
Beep.

576
00:32:18.325 --> 00:32:19.304
You made money.

577
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:20.105
Beep.

578
00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:21.465
Unfortunately,

579
00:32:21.924 --> 00:32:22.424
no.

580
00:32:23.539 --> 00:32:24.679
Well, that's sad.

581
00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:34.735
So as I talk about these countries, I'm I'm doing my best, frankly, to cheerlead them,

582
00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:36.255
if that makes sense.

583
00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:40.450
I want them to win. I want these countries in Africa to win.

584
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.250
I am always about an underdog. That's why I talk about

585
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.370
a Bhutan.

586
00:32:46.955 --> 00:32:49.775
I think Bhutan made a fabulous choice,

587
00:32:51.515 --> 00:32:52.015
spectacular

588
00:32:52.395 --> 00:32:54.174
by investing, I think, 100,000,000

589
00:32:54.635 --> 00:32:55.375
US dollars

590
00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:00.590
into Bitcoin mining operations in the Himalayas because, hey, it's cold.

591
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.310
We don't have to worry about our miners overheating.

592
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.445
We've got lots of hydroelectric

593
00:33:05.825 --> 00:33:08.245
power. Hey. Let's hook it up and

594
00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:10.005
build some sound money.

595
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.220
Yeah. Anyways, enough about that. As you know, I'm you know?

596
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.220
Just to wrap this,

597
00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:20.105
BlackRock,

598
00:33:20.485 --> 00:33:23.945
they're gonna make their millions. They're gonna make their 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000.

599
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.625
Unknown: I'm just as worried about the people

600
00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:28.505
out

601
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.090
McIntosh: on the border of Chile and Argentina

602
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.810
in that Andean mountain region.

603
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:38.305
God forbid I'm saying that wrong. I hope not.

604
00:33:39.245 --> 00:33:39.745
Who?

605
00:33:40.445 --> 00:33:41.265
They're experiencing

606
00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:42.545
a 145%

607
00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:44.305
roughly inflation.

608
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.800
Unknown: And unlike Diego, who we talked about who they can swap to dollars, and yes, it's it's a huge mess and

609
00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:56.605
it is not good for their business, but

610
00:33:57.705 --> 00:34:01.245
these people out in the sticks, so to speak, as we would say,

611
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.360
they can't do that.

612
00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:07.360
That's why Argentina needs sound money,

613
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.800
McIntosh: and then they need that transition so that

614
00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:12.715
the people in the sticks

615
00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:14.715
understand how to use

616
00:34:15.175 --> 00:34:16.315
the Bitcoin blockchain.

617
00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:17.915
You know, we

618
00:34:18.215 --> 00:34:20.315
we act like it's no big deal.

619
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.820
It is for a lot of people.

620
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.180
I hope that made sense. I think it all did. It all did in my head.

621
00:34:29.475 --> 00:34:30.615
It shouldn't yours.

622
00:34:31.795 --> 00:34:32.295
Sorry.

623
00:34:34.755 --> 00:34:35.255
Unknown: Yeah.

624
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:36.700
Yeah.

625
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.900
McIntosh: So good luck. Seriously,

626
00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:40.859
Argentina.

627
00:34:44.495 --> 00:34:46.275
Alright. Let's talk about our supporters,

628
00:34:46.815 --> 00:34:50.435
Kyrin. Kryin sent in a funny message this week. He sent in a,

629
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.890
row of ducks boost 2,222.

630
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.369
This was for episode 144. I want my right to mix,

631
00:34:58.685 --> 00:34:59.825
Unknown: the last episode.

632
00:35:01.485 --> 00:35:03.965
McIntosh: And I appreciate that boost, Kyrin, of course. He said

633
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.960
I had to Kyrin, to be honest before I read this, I had to go back and listen.

634
00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:18.125
I had to go back and listen to the entire episode. It actually happens near the end of the episode, at least the end of my discussion,

635
00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:19.405
the topic

636
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.410
to to kinda pick up on on what this was about.

637
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:31.015
He said, That pause after, quote, attack the government, quote, is going to get you put on

638
00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.655
so. And there's, like, 1, 2, 3,

639
00:35:33.955 --> 00:35:34.455
4,

640
00:35:35.155 --> 00:35:38.670
5 hoes, mini list. I'm like, what are you talking about?

641
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.069
And that's literally what I said. It's a little taken out of context, and I did pause

642
00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:48.895
just so everyone's clear,

643
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:53.135
in case I haven't mentioned it anytime soon.

644
00:35:53.859 --> 00:35:57.720
As I get older, as I my children get older, to be honest,

645
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.400
I find myself becoming more and more of a pacifist.

646
00:36:01.925 --> 00:36:07.545
When I was 21, I probably had a a different outlook than I do now. In fact, I know I did.

647
00:36:09.045 --> 00:36:09.545
And,

648
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.620
 I would never call

649
00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.140
for violence against

650
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.740
any government, and sometimes that's extremely difficult,

651
00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:21.515
Unknown: for taking of human life over political

652
00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:23.515
things.

653
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.810
McIntosh: The only time,

654
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:31.810
personally, to be honest, is, that I would believe in that is if you showed up at my house

655
00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:35.145
trying to rob and beat and,

656
00:36:35.845 --> 00:36:37.945
Unknown: you know, various sundry other things

657
00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:39.545
in my house,

658
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.940
McIntosh: you know, personal defense type things.

659
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.885
You'll find out I'm not a pacifist when it comes to that.

660
00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:52.145
So I guess I just got put on 14 more list,

661
00:36:52.685 --> 00:36:53.185
Kyrin.

662
00:36:54.685 --> 00:37:00.289
Fortunately, here in the United States, I don't think we've quite sunk to that level unless maybe you live in California,

663
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:01.089
Unknown: but

664
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.890
McIntosh: I just pray for the people in California. I don't know what to tell them,

665
00:37:07.585 --> 00:37:08.085
But

666
00:37:09.265 --> 00:37:10.725
I I would there

667
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:13.605
there's lines that when they get crossed

668
00:37:13.905 --> 00:37:15.765
that I will vote with my feet.

669
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.920
I'm also aware that a lot of people can't do that, unfortunately.

670
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.200
So I guess I'm in a,

671
00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:26.625
Unknown: privileged position, if you wanna call it that.

672
00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:31.105
McIntosh: I just know that there's a lot of people who can't necessarily get up and move

673
00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:32.145
if

674
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.470
their country does something that they just completely don't agree with, and they think that that's

675
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.150
what they should do.

676
00:37:39.985 --> 00:37:41.685
But they can't because they

677
00:37:42.145 --> 00:37:45.285
they have no money because their peso is inflated

678
00:37:45.745 --> 00:37:46.565
at a 145%.

679
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:48.830
I'm

680
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.910
sorry if if that sound like I was making fun of Argentina. I'm not. I'm

681
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.510
Unknown: just trying to

682
00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:57.845
proved my point because those people,

683
00:37:58.625 --> 00:37:59.125
again,

684
00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:06.970
McIntosh: who are out in the in the sticks says we would say here in the United States who, you know, they can't afford

685
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.010
Unknown: to move

686
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.970
if

687
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.890
because of that. And I'm

688
00:38:11.385 --> 00:38:14.365
McIntosh: I don't know. It's it's an extremely difficult position.

689
00:38:16.105 --> 00:38:16.605
Anyways,

690
00:38:16.905 --> 00:38:17.405
so

691
00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:21.050
I did not certainly, literally, me attack the government.

692
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:28.410
Unknown: So there you go. I guess maybe a little bit more about about McIntosh and about what goes on in in his head.

693
00:38:29.085 --> 00:38:31.565
McIntosh: It's convoluted. I'll tell you that. My head's

694
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:32.625
man.

695
00:38:33.325 --> 00:38:37.825
Unknown: The older I get, the more confused I get really, and it should be the opposite, which is

696
00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.280
not

697
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.720
good. Maybe.

698
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.840
I don't know.

699
00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.560
Life's hard sometimes.

700
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.080
McIntosh: It's the way it is.

701
00:38:46.425 --> 00:38:47.965
Alright. Anyways, wow.

702
00:38:48.345 --> 00:38:51.405
Kyrin, appreciate that. We're gonna move right along now.

703
00:38:51.865 --> 00:38:55.005
Got a couple of anonymous boost, which these are

704
00:38:55.319 --> 00:38:57.900
starting to get to be regular. I don't know if it's the same person.

705
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.940
I really appreciate it. Anonymous, whoever you are.

706
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.954
It's rather cool, actually, that you're boosting anonymously,

707
00:39:05.335 --> 00:39:09.994
and, literally, I have no way of knowing who you are. I don't even know what app you came from.

708
00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:12.075
That does not show up, so that's

709
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:12.900
Unknown: great.

710
00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.460
500 sat boost,

711
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.740
episode 143.

712
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.900
Are you in the right mindset?

713
00:39:19.655 --> 00:39:20.315
No message.

714
00:39:20.695 --> 00:39:22.315
And then a 100 sat boost,

715
00:39:22.855 --> 00:39:29.420
McIntosh: episode 144, I want my right to mix. So I appreciate both of those. If they were from the same person, I'm pretty sure that they are,

716
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.580
the total support was 2,772

717
00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.300
sets. So I do appreciate that. That was awesome.

718
00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:38.775
Yes. I I do appreciate

719
00:39:39.075 --> 00:39:39.895
the treasure

720
00:39:40.355 --> 00:39:43.175
that was shared here with generation Bitcoin.

721
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:51.280
I would like to share some with the listeners, and here's how we can do this. I mentioned from time to time, most weeks,

722
00:39:52.315 --> 00:39:57.615
if you clip an episode and what I mean is if you go to app like fountain and you clip

723
00:39:58.475 --> 00:40:00.250
1, 2, 3 minute clip

724
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:06.350
from the episode. If it's the current episode, it's a 500 sat boost back to you.

725
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.030
If it's

726
00:40:08.735 --> 00:40:09.955
an older episode,

727
00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:16.195
then it's 300 sats. It's a way for you to make some treasure. It's a way for you to make some sats

728
00:40:16.975 --> 00:40:19.640
from me, So you're welcome to do that.

729
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.040
Based on last week's recommendation,

730
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.200
I've actually started doing.

731
00:40:26.795 --> 00:40:35.470
I think I told you I might be doing this last week, but I implemented it. I've started implementing it. I'm splitting up my podcast across multiple

732
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.510
apps. I should have done this

733
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:39.310
previously.

734
00:40:40.475 --> 00:40:42.895
So now I have fountain, which I've used traditionally,

735
00:40:43.595 --> 00:40:46.815
podcast guru, which I'm really liking. I will say

736
00:40:47.675 --> 00:40:48.175
sometimes

737
00:40:48.475 --> 00:40:48.975
the

738
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.800
the UI, maybe not quite what I expect. I'm

739
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.960
managing to get around, but,

740
00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.295
but, you know, it is solid. It is very quick. I will say that. Definitely.

741
00:41:01.075 --> 00:41:06.470
I think it has a very bright future. And then also, Podverse, which I have used just in the past.

742
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.030
Looks like they just got a new version came out, 4.15.0.

743
00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:17.045
If you're on the beta test, I guess,

744
00:41:17.345 --> 00:41:20.964
you can click with Podverse. I can I know that you can do that?

745
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.770
You may have to let me know if you do that. I won't get automatically

746
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.970
noticed.

747
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:35.174
I won't automatically notice it if you do it on there. But I am I've got, like, 10 on here. I'm trying to get, like, 10 podcasts on each one to kinda spread this around,

748
00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:40.819
test out the different podcasts so maybe I can help people if they need help, give suggestions,

749
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.619
or just see what's out there regardless.

750
00:41:44.645 --> 00:41:52.185
So I'm now on three different ones. I'll probably bring on in 1 more this week and keep pulling stuff off of fountain. Fountain had been overloaded.

751
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.619
So we'll see how that experiment goes. News

752
00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.655
and links. Alright. I do wanna cover a bit of news, if you follow me on Twitter,

753
00:42:03.115 --> 00:42:08.330
I'm on @McintoshFintech. I post kind of in real time as I see these things come up.

754
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.870
Of course, I've already talked about Javier Milei.

755
00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.630
Unknown: He is the new president.

756
00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:22.484
McIntosh: I posted about a video. This is what I was talking about. Ministry of Culture out, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development out, so

757
00:42:23.025 --> 00:42:25.204
Unknown: on and so forth. It's just like

758
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.590
Ministry of Public Works,

759
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.950
McIntosh: Ministry of Science Technology Innovation.

760
00:42:33.315 --> 00:42:37.895
Look. I'm not saying that some of these are not bad things. I mean, like, maybe,

761
00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.655
I don't know, environmental,

762
00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:41.495
what, Ministry of Transportation.

763
00:42:42 --> 00:42:43.220
We probably need that.

764
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.420
We need transportation. We need a transportation

765
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.620
policy, I should say, in a nation.

766
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.580
But

767
00:42:51.815 --> 00:42:54.955
these things, they take over. They get a life of their own.

768
00:42:55.495 --> 00:42:56.315
And so

769
00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:00.620
I you know, in a country that's at a 145%

770
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:01.980
inflation

771
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.940
that is printing money like no tomorrow,

772
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:10.085
they have to do these kind of things just to stop the bleeding. They have to figure out,

773
00:43:11.105 --> 00:43:16.645
you know, what's what can we trim back? And then maybe at some point, if they need something,

774
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:23.210
they add it back, but you've got to build a solid base. And right now, they don't have that. So, anyways,

775
00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.130
interesting stuff there.

776
00:43:27.345 --> 00:43:30.085
I thought this was interesting. This guy named wicked,

777
00:43:31.105 --> 00:43:31.605
w_s_bitcoin

778
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.910
that I follow, he posted this.

779
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:46.805
And he said, you may not like this, but within the next few years, I bet one of the 1st Bitcoin mints and what he's talking about, I believe, is like stablecoin

780
00:43:47.185 --> 00:43:47.685
on

781
00:43:47.985 --> 00:43:48.485
Bitcoin.

782
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.700
Of lightning maybe

783
00:43:51.079 --> 00:43:51.740
with Taproot,

784
00:43:52.359 --> 00:44:04.945
for example, will emerge that becomes highly trusted and lasts for centuries. You don't you won't have to trust it, but many will, and they'll be fine. So this is kind of the argument. Well, we want Bitcoin to be noncustodial.

785
00:44:05.485 --> 00:44:06.225
That's certainly

786
00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:09.280
absolutely the best. But with

787
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:15.119
the number of people in the world, with the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, it will be necessary,

788
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.835
is this argument that that there are trusted

789
00:44:19.135 --> 00:44:19.635
institutions

790
00:44:20.015 --> 00:44:20.515
essentially

791
00:44:20.895 --> 00:44:24.035
that that we use for Bitcoin services, and

792
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.130
it's going to happen whether you like it or not.

793
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.970
It remains to be seen how stable those are,

794
00:44:31.509 --> 00:44:34.170
and some of them will not last. But

795
00:44:35.694 --> 00:44:39.315
it will be part of the fabric, and you're just you will have to deal with that.

796
00:44:41.055 --> 00:44:46.960
Not everybody can afford a $10 on chain fee. I mean, just that's just not gonna happen.

797
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.640
So, anyways,

798
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.800
thought that was interesting.

799
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.320
He also pointed,

800
00:44:53.105 --> 00:44:54.964
he also posted earlier today.

801
00:44:55.505 --> 00:44:56.724
For the first time ever,

802
00:44:57.025 --> 00:44:58.085
more than 70%,

803
00:44:58.625 --> 00:45:00.885
7 0% of all Bitcoin

804
00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.540
has been hodled

805
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.619
or or held in cold storage for more than one year. That's incredible.

806
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.020
Unknown: Strike,

807
00:45:10.385 --> 00:45:12.965
McIntosh: some updates, you can read about that as well.

808
00:45:13.505 --> 00:45:15.685
More ways of getting money,

809
00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:19.630
fiat into the system, in the form of Bitcoin.

810
00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:21.950
Getting money out.

811
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.430
You know, of course, this is a

812
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.030
KYC service,

813
00:45:26.734 --> 00:45:27.875
but it is available

814
00:45:28.575 --> 00:45:30.035
virtually all over the globe.

815
00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:34.595
Fidelity who they're a huge asset manager,

816
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.140
and they've been very vocal about their Bitcoin support.

817
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.740
Said if powering Bitcoin, a global digital monetary network, is considered wasteful,

818
00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:48.615
then what does that make the traditional financial system? For some context,

819
00:45:48.994 --> 00:45:52.055
Fidelity is part of the traditional financial system.

820
00:45:53.370 --> 00:46:01.230
It's one of the world's it's one of the largest financial institutes in North America. Every day, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is the best asset

821
00:46:02.615 --> 00:46:06.955
that we have, large financial institutions are coming out to say this BlackRock.

822
00:46:07.575 --> 00:46:11.400
These are some of the wealthiest people and organizations in the world. So,

823
00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:14.220
yes. I do believe that 2025

824
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.660
2024,

825
00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:16.779
excuse me,

826
00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:18.380
will be the year

827
00:46:19.455 --> 00:46:20.435
of the institution.

828
00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:23.155
Last year this year, excuse me,

829
00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:24.595
year of regulation,

830
00:46:25.055 --> 00:46:29.240
and I've been pretty accurate about that. That regulation will continue.

831
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:37.625
Some of it we may not like. In fact, maybe a lot of it we don't like, but it will continue. But next year will be the year of the institution.

832
00:46:38.005 --> 00:46:39.545
And I don't mean MicroStrategy.

833
00:46:39.925 --> 00:46:40.585
I mean,

834
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.505
BlackRock. I mean,

835
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:53.275
Fidelity. I mean, these type companies, ETFs will come online, and they even if they're approved at this point before the end of the year, which is not guaranteed,

836
00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:59.595
they will not come online until next year. So I'm going to go on record right now

837
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.270
prior to January 1st saying that next year will be the year

838
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:05.630
of the institution

839
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.310
becoming involved

840
00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.030
in Bitcoin in a big, big way.

841
00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:14.494
And one more, I had to throw this in, Peruvian bull, which is

842
00:47:14.795 --> 00:47:15.295
Peruvian

843
00:47:15.595 --> 00:47:16.655
underscore bull.

844
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:17.990
Said

845
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:18.870
this.

846
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.510
CPI was lower than expectations

847
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.310
because

848
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.430
health insurance costs were, checks, notes,

849
00:47:26.175 --> 00:47:26.915
down 38%.

850
00:47:27.855 --> 00:47:30.835
Who actually believes this crap? So what he's talking about,

851
00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.795
our CPI numbers came out this week, and

852
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:39.690
they were lower. They were, like, 3.8 instead of 3.9 or whatever it was percent inflation.

853
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.065
And one of the big things was health insurance was down 38%.

854
00:47:44.685 --> 00:47:49.345
I promise you health insurance costs have not got suddenly gone down 38%

855
00:47:49.725 --> 00:47:53.820
year over year in the United States. That is complete and other baloney.

856
00:47:54.200 --> 00:48:00.924
I have no idea how they even came up with that, but that's the kind of stuff that they use to skew the data. It's crazy.

857
00:48:03.224 --> 00:48:07.484
So I believe I've mentioned this, the parliament the EU parliament

858
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:14.290
had a bill come up before it essentially, and that maybe they don't call it a bill, but it's a bill at least in our lingo,

859
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:16.210
about

860
00:48:16.895 --> 00:48:18.115
chat surveillance,

861
00:48:18.415 --> 00:48:18.915
essentially,

862
00:48:19.375 --> 00:48:23.714
warrantless mass surveillance of phones and circumventing end to end encryption.

863
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:31.599
Fortunately, with an overwhelming 51 to 2 vote, the parliament has decided against that. So that's really good news for the EU.

864
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.045
I'm proud of y'all. I have no idea how your system works if you

865
00:48:36.425 --> 00:48:38.365
called your congressman or whatever,

866
00:48:38.825 --> 00:48:40.845
your parliament member. I apologize

867
00:48:41.145 --> 00:48:43.550
for my naive to tell you, but I promise

868
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:49.704
I would bet most of you don't actually know how our system works either. So, hey, it goes both ways. Right?

869
00:48:51.285 --> 00:48:54.825
But we'll fumble through it. Anyways, that's really good

870
00:48:55.204 --> 00:48:57.464
that y'all did that. So great news.

871
00:48:58.349 --> 00:49:00.930
And here in back in the US, $8,200,000,000,000

872
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.810
of US debt will be maturing

873
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.425
in the next 12 months. So what that means is that debt will roll over,

874
00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:11.785
and it will roll over at a higher interest rate. So

875
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.480
more interest will be generated

876
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.880
that will have to be paid as part of our debt, and we're already

877
00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:21.525
approaching if not at $1,000,000,000,000

878
00:49:22.464 --> 00:49:26.005
a year in interest alone on the federal

879
00:49:26.305 --> 00:49:27.525
debt. It's insane.

880
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.940
It's insane. It's insanity.

881
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.580
Alright. There we go. That's it. That's what I had for the news.

882
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:39.235
I've told y'all before this is time of year. Things just kinda slow up a little bit.

883
00:49:39.775 --> 00:49:45.160
No ETF news this week. No real crazy things. The SEC did actually

884
00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:48.119
ask a few of the ETF

885
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.599
companies who wanted the ETFs

886
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.240
basically to make some changes

887
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.280
to their,

888
00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:56.985
their plan,

889
00:49:58.565 --> 00:49:59.385
which actually

890
00:49:59.765 --> 00:50:11.250
were beneficial towards Bitcoin. I'm not really gonna go into that. It's kind of in the weed stuff, but it was a good thing. I'm not sure that these will be approved before the end of the year. I'm quite confident that they will be approved.

891
00:50:11.744 --> 00:50:12.645
Unknown: You can argue

892
00:50:13.425 --> 00:50:15.845
whether they're good or bad. They are happening.

893
00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:20.085
McIntosh: Now we can the price will benefit. We all know that.

894
00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.500
Is it best for Bitcoin?

895
00:50:23.279 --> 00:50:32.235
It's not best for Bitcoin for those people. That's not the best way to own Bitcoin, but I'd rather they do that than own, I don't know,

896
00:50:33.175 --> 00:50:34.315
Microsoft stonker.

897
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.130
Chat API

898
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:37.010
GPT.

899
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.010
Sorry. Chat GPT.

900
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.730
I think that's a better bet,

901
00:50:43.505 --> 00:50:48.005
So I'm okay with it from that perspective. Does it violate Bitcoin? Does it

902
00:50:49.185 --> 00:50:52.410
circumvent the rules? Does it you know? No. It's

903
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:54.170
Unknown: all proper legal,

904
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.930
you know, the way that it

905
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.050
it's operating within the protocol rules, so therefore,

906
00:50:59.414 --> 00:51:01.755
it's like ordinals. I I hate ordinals,

907
00:51:03.255 --> 00:51:03.755
but

908
00:51:04.615 --> 00:51:05.755
McIntosh: ordinals are allowed.

909
00:51:06.134 --> 00:51:10.300
And until that changes, if consensus is given and that's changed.

910
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:16.060
Then they're there, and they're cluttering up the mining blocks and causing high fees and,

911
00:51:16.695 --> 00:51:19.115
but that high fees may drive innovation.

912
00:51:19.895 --> 00:51:22.395
We're much better prepared than we were in 2017,

913
00:51:22.695 --> 00:51:27.760
for example, for high fees, and we will have high fees. This bull run. I promise you.

914
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.880
People are gonna be crying over these rates.

915
00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:38.305
You should be getting prepared. We will talk about that. I've already said that. You really do need to be getting prepared. If you've got lightning channels,

916
00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:39.825
you need to get them.

917
00:51:40.365 --> 00:51:47.380
You need to make sure that those are the size that they need to be, and that includes your Phoenix wallet, by the way, if you happen to use that

918
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.380
or some such custodial

919
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:50.660
setup

920
00:51:51.164 --> 00:51:56.785
because people are finding, oh, I'm trying to send this tiny little thing to my

921
00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:02.690
lightning wallet, and it's charging a $10 fee. Well, it's because it's having to splice in a channel,

922
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:03.810
and it's

923
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:10.705
expanding it, so it's doing an on chain transaction. Well, the on chain transactions or off the chain.

924
00:52:11.565 --> 00:52:15.025
That's probably not a good way to say that, but they're really high.

925
00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.799
So therefore, they get charged for that. So you need to think about these things now,

926
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.839
not when the fees are double, triple what they are

927
00:52:23.435 --> 00:52:26.335
even though they're already high. So that's it.

928
00:52:26.715 --> 00:52:27.935
That's what we got.

929
00:52:28.475 --> 00:52:38.420
Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2 point o. We are a value for value podcast. I do not have sponsors. I do not have advertising. I've actually done a lot of thought about this.

930
00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:41.065
I'm currently not going to do that.

931
00:52:41.605 --> 00:52:49.550
Maybe I'll talk about this. I'm not gonna do this tonight, but there's a point in time I wanna talk about this. I've actually found out some interesting things. For example,

932
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:56.190
one of my favorite podcasts. I'm gonna throw this out real quick, and then I'm gonna wrap this up. I'm gonna skip a lot of this.

933
00:52:56.775 --> 00:53:00.795
One of my favorite podcasts I listen to. So I'm a token fanatic and

934
00:53:01.735 --> 00:53:03.595
lord of the rings, simrillion,

935
00:53:03.975 --> 00:53:07.510
the hobbit, you know, all the back material, all this stuff.

936
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:09.910
I'm a fanatic. I read it

937
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:12.150
more than I should.

938
00:53:13.244 --> 00:53:18.224
And, so I listened to this podcast. It's called the prancing pony, which was the name of,

939
00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:20.650
let's see. That was the name of the

940
00:53:21.529 --> 00:53:24.349
in in Bree. Cute little name. Prancing Pony.

941
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:28.029
Show's been around for a long time. They have 12,000

942
00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:32.785
downloads or users, whatever, listeners is what he called it, 12,000 listeners.

943
00:53:33.165 --> 00:53:37.105
I assume that means per episode. I assume that means on a regular basis,

944
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:40.890
But they do, you know,

945
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.050
a bucket load

946
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:44.570
of

947
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.530
advertising.

948
00:53:45.975 --> 00:53:51.915
Like, you wade through, like, 3 minutes of advertising up front and then, like, 2 minutes in the middle, and it's ridiculous.

949
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:58.589
They're clearly not value for value. They're certainly not value for value. They do not stream sets.

950
00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:02.049
Unknown: They don't, you know, accept boost, anything like that.

951
00:54:02.454 --> 00:54:03.755
That's not my point.

952
00:54:05.734 --> 00:54:06.875
McIntosh: I'm not at 12,000

953
00:54:07.415 --> 00:54:15.740
downloads per episode, 12,000 listeners, however you wanna put it. I'm not. I'm a long way from there, but I could see one day being at that point.

954
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:23.555
Unknown: I do not know. We will see when I get to that point how the value for value side of this is doing.

955
00:54:23.935 --> 00:54:26.675
I would hope it's doing much better than it is now

956
00:54:27.055 --> 00:54:31.250
because as I provide value, I would hope that people would give that value back.

957
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.130
But I also know that

958
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:35.810
with 12,000

959
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.290
downloads, you know, they have

960
00:54:39.895 --> 00:54:41.275
2 hosts, they have

961
00:54:42.215 --> 00:54:44.075
an audio editor. They have

962
00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:52.740
community support. They have all this stuff that that they do. So they clearly are making a lot of money off of their advertising. So

963
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.375
I don't know.

964
00:54:55.815 --> 00:54:58.635
McIntosh: I know there's a lot of stuff that I will never touch.

965
00:54:59.735 --> 00:55:01.515
You'll never see me hawk

966
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:03.069
ledger wallets.

967
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.990
Now I have no problem talking about seed signer, which is an open source product,

968
00:55:09.665 --> 00:55:12.325
which you literally can buy the pieces and put yourself

969
00:55:12.785 --> 00:55:18.165
together. But I would not even take money from seed signer if they offered it to me.

970
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:25.800
Because if there were ever a problem, I do not want my listeners to come back to me and say, Macintosh,

971
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:29.935
you told us to use seed signer, and we did, and we lost money.

972
00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:44.940
Why did you do that? Well, first of all, I'll never tell you to do seed signer. I will tell you I use seed signer. I'm about to order 1 for my mining business because I need it. But I'm not gonna tell you to do that. I'm just gonna lay out why it might work for you.

973
00:55:45.974 --> 00:55:51.595
And I want no financial gain from that if you go to seed signer because that will absolutely

974
00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:53.355
sway my opinion.

975
00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:56.630
So there are a lot of things that I will never

976
00:55:57.329 --> 00:55:57.829
never

977
00:55:59.329 --> 00:56:05.185
think about as a sponsor. Is there a time maybe when I would take sponsors who are

978
00:56:05.724 --> 00:56:10.145
I can't even think of the problem is I can't think of anything. I'm sure there are.

979
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.640
I don't know. Maybe a seed plate

980
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.920
where you put your seed,

981
00:56:17.914 --> 00:56:26.734
words into aluminum plates or steel, stainless steel. I don't know how you could possibly go wrong with that, and maybe I wouldn't have any problem,

982
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.280
quote shilling that. I don't know.

983
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:30.720
We'll see.

984
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:35.200
Unknown: I'm also very aware of what it sounds like when you have ads in the middle of your

985
00:56:36.275 --> 00:56:38.695
material. Even if it's a kind of a

986
00:56:39.075 --> 00:56:48.470
McIntosh: what do they call it? A native ad where you kinda mix it in. Oh, I those actually could be the most nefarious where, oh, you don't know that they're getting paid to do that.

987
00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.230
Unknown: I don't know.

988
00:56:51.214 --> 00:56:51.714
McIntosh: Anyways,

989
00:56:52.335 --> 00:57:00.115
we don't have any sponsors, and we don't have any advertising. We do depend on the listener. There's 3 different ways you can do that, time, talent, or treasure.

990
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.180
Go out, try one of these podcast 2 point o apps if you haven't.

991
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.140
Fountain,

992
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.220
podcast

993
00:57:09.115 --> 00:57:09.615
guru

994
00:57:10.395 --> 00:57:11.375
or Podverse.

995
00:57:11.755 --> 00:57:19.220
Most of you probably do listen to a lot of podcasts. Maybe you could do, like, what I'm doing where I kind of split it up, and I'll see how they work for me.

996
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:25.860
But if you have a podcasting 2 point o app, then you can support a show like ours. You can boost. You can send messages.

997
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.140
Unknown: You can stream,

998
00:57:28.535 --> 00:57:30.395
McIntosh: to the show as well. Stream stats

999
00:57:30.775 --> 00:57:35.435
to support the show just like anonymous did earlier and Kyron did earlier.

1000
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:37.470
Anyways,

1001
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:42.810
enough about that. I rattled on enough tonight. I do appreciate y'all being here. I am very much

1002
00:57:43.405 --> 00:57:45.505
can I be honest? I hope I can be honest.

1003
00:57:45.885 --> 00:57:50.704
I'm very much looking forward to this time off. Not I will miss doing this,

1004
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:55.030
But the commitment that it takes to do this twice a week,

1005
00:57:55.410 --> 00:58:02.455
especially for months on end, and I do, again, apologize. I say twice a week, and then, McIntosh, you weren't on last Thursday. Well,

1006
00:58:02.915 --> 00:58:03.815
that was life.

1007
00:58:04.435 --> 00:58:06.615
These things do happen from time to time,

1008
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.660
but it's pretty rare.

1009
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.300
It's it's pretty high,

1010
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.420
and I'm looking forward to this time off. But I'm also,

1011
00:58:14.875 --> 00:58:19.695
while I'm gonna be gone, I'm going to do some things. I know I'm gonna move the podcast,

1012
00:58:20.235 --> 00:58:23.535
Unknown: which will help us in the future with the podcast 2 point o stuff.

1013
00:58:24.289 --> 00:58:25.109
I know.

1014
00:58:26.289 --> 00:58:26.789
Well,

1015
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:33.750
I'll tell you more when I come back in January or the last day of December or whatever I decide to do

1016
00:58:34.555 --> 00:58:35.055
because

1017
00:58:35.434 --> 00:58:36.815
we're gonna come back and say

1018
00:58:37.595 --> 00:58:38.095
2024,

1019
00:58:39.755 --> 00:58:41.055
the year of the institutions.

1020
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.829
McIntosh: It's so easy when it's so obvious.

1021
00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:50.790
But, yeah, that's gonna be a big thing next year. There's gonna be a lot of things next year.

1022
00:58:51.805 --> 00:58:53.905
Next year will be the start of the bull run

1023
00:58:54.925 --> 00:59:00.200
if we're not already there, and I don't I think we're gonna kinda grind up for the rest of the year

1024
00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.619
unless these ETFs get approved. If they do, all bets off, we may shoot right up

1025
00:59:07 --> 00:59:10.185
for a good bit. We may come back down, but we'll shoot right up.

1026
00:59:11.385 --> 00:59:16.445
It may kick off that bull market a little early, and I don't know what that would do about the end of it. We'll see.

1027
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:21.570
If we do really get going early on, I may have to evaluate

1028
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.170
Q4 2025.

1029
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:26.675
But for now, I'll stick with that.

1030
00:59:27.155 --> 00:59:29.735
Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful.

1031
00:59:30.035 --> 00:59:31.575
I would love to hear from you.

1032
00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.455
I always love hearing from y'all.

1033
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:36.470
I'm on you can

1034
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:42.550
post me a message. That's the most direct way to get ahold of me. I'm also on Twitter at Macintosh Fintech.

1035
00:59:43.405 --> 00:59:47.905
As long as I don't get kicked off or maybe you I don't know. I'm on at

1036
00:59:48.205 --> 00:59:51.080
Macintosh at podcast index dot social as well.

1037
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.260
That's it. Stay humble friends. Go out. Make it a great week. I'll talk to y'all soon.
