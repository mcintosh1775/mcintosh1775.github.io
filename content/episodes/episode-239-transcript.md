[00:00:09] McIntosh:

Welcome back to Satoshi's Plebs for episode two thirty nine. I'm Mcintosh. 

[00:00:14] Kenshin:

I am Kenshin. And in today's episode, we look ahead to 2026. 

[00:00:20] McIntosh:

Alright, Kenshin. It's been a couple weeks. How long has it been? Happy New Year. Right before Chris Chris yeah. It's been a year. It's been a whole year. We recorded right before Christmas. So Alright. I guess we're looking right at two weeks. Right? We didn't there was no episode last week. Sorry, guys. I was in North Carolina. I guess that will go into what I was doing, but, yeah, not available for podcasting. 

And this week, frankly, almost didn't happen. I was getting a little concerned there. My laptop, my excuse me, my desktop has decided that networking is optional and not a necessity. And having a big fight with the WiFi that's partially MediaCom, partially probably this desktop as well. But, yeah, good times. 

[00:01:14] Kenshin:

Good times. 

[00:01:16] McIntosh:

Alright. Let's jump on into it. Yeah. Yeah. Did you have a good New Year's You haven't spoken actually. No. We really have it. I mean, we texted probably well, we use signal, yeah. Probably twice, I think, in the last couple of weeks. And I mean, I'm let's be honest. I missed you, Kenshin. I I hope everything's going good for you there in Sweden. 

I get, you know, I get used to these meetings every week, and it's like, man, wow. That's kind of a bummer. We did go up to North Carolina, which is in the Appalachian Region, the mountainous region of The United States, and we did not see snow. It did not snow while we were there. When we first got there, there was a chance at the end of the week that there was going to be snow and it turned out to be rain. It was not weren't cold enough, and that was on the last day anyways when we were traveling, so it was kind of a worst case thing. We we the travel was fine, actually. We came back on Saturday at the end of the New Year's holiday or whatever, and apparently everybody decided they wanted to travel on Sunday. So, basically, I blasted down from from Appalachia, from North Carolina there right through Atlanta and on our way. 

I I think I think we had a good Christmas. I mean, I feel like we did. All the kids were home. No major incidents. I I don't know. I it was it was a good Christmas. I mean, it was. I well, I will tell you this. I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and tell you this. Yep. 

[00:03:06] Kenshin:

I 

[00:03:07] McIntosh:

love to cook Chinese food, which maybe sounds odd, but it's really the only kind of cooking I really truly enjoy. And it's only because I love Chinese food so much. And the Chinese food that you get here in America by and large is not really high quality or it's not really authentic. And so over the last two three years I've attempted to learn how to cook Chinese food. 

And I have a wok which is the basic cooking instrument with Chinese meals and but I have a stove that's electric top. It's not like a gas stove so there's no flame. Yeah. And one of the I don't wanna say it's a problem, but with Chinese food, typically when you're cooking it in a wok, there are times at least when you need very high heat, like super high heat. It actually gives it, I'm I'm gonna butcher the way I say this, I apologize to all the Chinese people, the one fourth in the world in advance, but I believe it's called wok hei and it's a smoky flavor aromatic thing that gets added to it and it is strictly because you're cooking in a wok that's seasoned properly over very high heat. 

Alright? So how do we do that? I got my one of my daughters and my wife collaborated, this was actually for my birthday but I'll throw it in here, and bought a two grill, a two burner grill that you hook up to propane. Each one of those burners can put out 100,000 BTUs of heat which is a lot. And then for Christmas, I think it was my wife actually got me a big pot because the other thing that this is very good for is, like, seafood boils and turkey, like, frying turkey. So you can actually fry a whole turkey in this pot. You you fill it with oil. You you heat it super hot. You put the turkey in there and it cooks within, I wanna say, like, half an hour. I'm I'm probably really wrong on that. But Okay. 

But yeah. I've gotta build a stand for it. I don't have anywhere to put all of this stuff so I literally have to build like a grill stand for it that will keep in the garage and then you wheel out and you use it outside. And it's gonna be awesome. I'll have to get another walk and be doing two walks and it'll get all crazy. Probably should put it on video except I don't want to be on the Internet. Yeah. It was good. And one final thing I did wanna go ahead and announce because I'll have it here next well, maybe I won't. I'm not actually sure. I am gonna go ahead. I told Kenshin I'm gonna go ahead and order a new microphone. 

A pretty fancy one. I've been putting this off for years literally, and I've put together the money for it. It's Electro Voice RE three twenty. And to be honest, I'm doing this on the advice of Adam Curry of Podcasting two point o fame. This is the same microphone that he uses, and they were discussing it one day. And I said, that sounds like the microphone that I want. And I wrote it down, and I've been keeping hold of it. So is this I'm gonna order it. I don't know if it'll be here before next week or not, but I am ordering it. So that's that's what's gonna make this podcast successful now? Oh, yeah. No. Guaranteed a million downloads because Macintosh upgraded his yeah. No. Cool. No unfortunately it will not and that's kind of what keeps me from it keeps me hesitating like should I really spend this kind of money But, know, I don't what do you do? You only live once. 

Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Anyways, what's going on with you, man? Has it been raining there in Sweden like it was up in North Carolina? 

[00:07:38] Kenshin:

Oh, I wish. I mean, it's oh, it's been snowing like crazy the last few days. And the the bad thing with snow here is that we have a small part of road and an area where we park our cars and that's in our land and and so we need to clean up ourselves with shovels and we have a snowplow machine that's very hard to operate. So every time it snows, it's it's just a pain. And even my son, he saw the snow and he was super excited and I said, okay, yeah, but now we need to go and clean. So we go and clean. 



[00:08:20] McIntosh:

It's no longer fun. 

[00:08:22] Kenshin:

Yeah. Exactly. For a couple of hours. Two days later, it snows again. My son's reaction is like, oh, no. We need to clean again. 

[00:08:31] McIntosh:

I said, exactly. That's why I asked I can help you with some of that. I don't know about this road part, but I did give you some recommendations. I don't think you're gonna do it. But I I believe you should just set up a Bitcoin miner in your basement and run the, you could do the you can route it. You gotta do something with the heat. Right? And they generate a lot of heat. You can route it through piping out underneath your sidewalk and your driveway. And during the winter, you you run that hot air through there and bingo, no snow. 

Telling you, it'll work. 

[00:09:09] Kenshin:

Yeah. And yet somehow you seem to be hesitant. I don't Yeah. I think the pipes will just freeze. It's so it's minus 10 degrees Celsius here so it's 

[00:09:21] McIntosh:

Brother. Okay. Minus 10 in Celsius. What is that in Fahrenheit? What is the coldest you've ever seen it there in Sweden? We're fixing to learn Minus a little 

[00:09:39] Kenshin:

20. 

[00:09:40] McIntosh:

Okay. Minus 20. 20. I was gonna say. Minus 20 Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

[00:09:48] Kenshin:

I don't even know how to spell Fahrenheit. 

[00:09:50] McIntosh:

Oh that's only minus four Fahrenheit. Okay. Well it doesn't surprise me because you are basically you're close to the water. Right? Or yeah. No. You are. Mean, the whole 

[00:10:04] Kenshin:

The whole country is. Right? No. The whole country is surrounded by water. Yeah. Okay. So 

[00:10:12] McIntosh:

your country is surrounded by water. 

Yes. You're very far north. And it sounds you know, you go, well, it's the Arctic, basically, but that water is still warmer than the air, and it actually helps keep it warm. 

[00:10:28] Kenshin:

The water gets Interior Alaska, 

[00:10:31] McIntosh:

it gets down to minus 40 or more Fahrenheit. Okay? So you're at minus four. I don't I'll convert minus okay. Hold on. 

[00:10:43] Kenshin:

Well, the the the lakes here freeze. Sure. And even and even the sea around Sweden freezes a bit. So the sea between Sweden and Finland freezes. 

[00:10:55] McIntosh:

Interesting. Minus 40 Fahrenheit is actually minus 40 Celsius. Oh yeah. That's the same. That's true. I did not know that. So that so you know I'm not worried about those pipes. Look that heat coming out is like 200 degrees and it only runs a couple 100 feet. You had strong plasti Look. I don't I've not done this. Okay. We don't really get snow where I live. So I got that going for me, I guess. But I know people do have done this and I think it would actually work very well but I'm crazy. It could. So don't listen to me. 



[00:11:36] Kenshin:

It could. It sounds like a good way to to waste a lot of money 

[00:11:41] McIntosh:

for small benefits. You're probably being very smart there. Yes. But you do get KYC free Bitcoin in the end. Yeah. That's that's Alright. Enough about that. People don't wanna hear about that. Sorry. Besides the snow, did you have a good Christmas? 

[00:11:58] Kenshin:

I did. I'm trying to remember. We just had like a couple of visitors over Christmas and that was it, thankfully. And I was so focused on 

[00:12:14] McIntosh:

You're an introvert, 

[00:12:15] Kenshin:

aren't you? On my project with my wife. So even during Christmas, I I had to do a commit here and there. So the whole time spent these Christmas vacations at home and coding, basically. 

So yeah. Which is a bit frustrating because the whole time passed, and I thought I would have gone live by now. Right. And I'm back to my Fiat job and, oh, I was really dreading it yesterday. Today was my first day back at work. So, yeah, that's the frustration when you when vacations are over. 

[00:12:54] McIntosh:

And yeah. Yeah. I didn't even talk about work, but we did a freeze while for two weeks during Christmas and New Year's and so like no code changes. And really what that means is when we came back, everybody gets back on Monday which is when I started. Like just I was in two HPI calls. 

Like HPI is like when there's a customer impacting problem. Right? Mhmm. Just right out of the gate on Monday, it was great. I literally went from one to the other. So I was on a Zoom call for a major portion of the day. I was up until 11:00 Monday night on one of them. It's just nuts. I would never recommend that. I know a lot of companies do that but the actual problem is it just builds up issues. Anyways Yeah. Going back is never fun after two weeks. You need to, like, ease in, like, just one day. Okay? And then the next week, you go two days and the next week And 

[00:14:01] Kenshin:

then you're back for summer vacations. 



[00:14:04] McIntosh:

Yeah. Really what we need to do, Kenshin, is just quit. We just I don't know. We we need to figure out this podcasting thing 

[00:14:14] Kenshin:

quit our jobs. That that was my my goal for 2025. 

[00:14:19] McIntosh:

To quit your job by podcasting? 

[00:14:22] Kenshin:

No. Not by but by the end of the year. 

[00:14:29] McIntosh:

We should have talked about that before you had that as a goal. Oh man. 

[00:14:36] Kenshin:

Well, that's my goal for 2026 by the way so Let's 

[00:14:42] McIntosh:

see. I we're close. Okay. We're jumping way ahead. Hold on. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. The way ladies and gentlemen we are at Block Heights 931313 as we record. 

And yeah, so today we in general, we just we're getting kind of I don't wanna say freelances, but we're gonna be a little looser than normal. It's been a couple weeks. We're gonna get back. We are gonna give our predictions. We we said last or last time we talked that we were gonna go ahead and do predictions. I hope you've got some good ones. I I need to come up with some good ones but that's a different story. We'll talk about the news a little bit because there have been some things going on and so off we go. Do you want to start with predictions or news or or I guess we'll start with some predictions, We 

[00:15:38] Kenshin:

can start with some news actually because we we just passed January 3. 

Okay. 

[00:15:45] McIntosh:

Why happened on January 3? 

[00:15:48] Kenshin:

Well, we had the new year and that was a big milestone but January 3 was an even bigger milestone was the the Genesis block. Basically, block number zero 

[00:16:00] McIntosh:

for Bitcoin. The first So I'm having to do math here which is never a good thing. That was seventeen years ago. Right? Yes. 2009. Yeah. 1929 will be 

[00:16:14] Kenshin:

yeah. '17. '17. Right. 

[00:16:17] McIntosh:

So he mined the Genesis block. Now Mhmm. I argued that he didn't technically mine it but that's what everybody says so I'm just gonna shut up and we're gonna move on. 

[00:16:28] Kenshin:

There was a reward of 50 bitcoins. Yes. There was. And 

[00:16:32] McIntosh:

he embedded in that block some text and there was a nice picture. 

You know, it says text. Okay. I'm actually not sure. I believe it was just the text. Yeah. It was the text. And it was from the times. I believe that's London. What times was it? It's on your note. There it is. Times Saturday. Yeah. UK. Yeah. So it'd be the London Times or whatever. Sorry British people. I'd it's I know it's a really important newspaper to you. I'm all respected. It's like the New York Times. And said, 01/03/2009, chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks. And some people think this was a message. I believe that it was. It just happened to align and right on the front page of the times, January 9 or third 01/03/2009. 

Sorry. Yeah. 01/03/2009. Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. So he literally took that paper and put the contents, at least that headline, in the block to verify this was legitimate essentially and kind of make a little message. I also think it's interesting not to get too far off in the political spectrum here but right above that Israel prepared to send tanks and troops into Gaza 

[00:18:01] Kenshin:

And I'm just gonna let that lie there. Alright. Yeah. You know you know what caught my eye when I saw this newspaper? Mhmm. The first thing that caught my eye, on the top right under the title, says eat out from five pounds. Right. From five pounds. Yeah. And I was actually looking. 



[00:18:20] McIntosh:

Yeah. My goodness. They have an ad for a 99p which is like 99¢, I believe, pint. A pub pint. Like a, I mean, a beer. Right. It says pub chain cuts the price of a pint from a dollar 69 to 9 man, it's hard to read this. To $19.89 levels. So it was at okay. So it was like a sale at least temporarily. It was but it's astounding to think I think now you go in and it's like $5 or something. Right? And and Salman Rushdie said that he would not marry again. What's that? Yeah. He wrote a book. He was I believe it's still in effect. He they had like a death threat against him, the Islams, basically because he wrote about Muhammad. He said something bad about Muhammad. I'm sorry. I do not remember the details at this point. Doesn't matter. So I probably just butchered that but it's enough. 

And he ended up in London I think. Anyways. Interesting time travel. Yeah. I would love to eat out for $5. 

[00:19:47] Kenshin:

Yeah. 

[00:19:49] McIntosh:

Would be nice. Yeah. Crazy. But this is inflation. This is it's what it is. I I don't know. It should be very obvious, but it's just subtle enough that I people know. They just don't they don't care enough. Anyways Yeah. Now there was a second event that's happening in just a couple days. We want to in terms of time, we just wanted to mention this as well because I thought this was pretty cool. You wanna go ahead and do that one? 

[00:20:27] Kenshin:

Yeah. So so the first the first block Mhmm. Was the Genesis block as we talked about, January 3, but the first Bitcoin transaction was 10 Bitcoin sent from Nakamoto to Halfini on January 12. 

Right. And it's coming up then next week, January 12. And you pointed out. Yeah. That was on block 170 Mhmm. Which meant between January 3 and January 12 there were a 170 

[00:21:03] McIntosh:

A 100 exactly. A lot of empty blocks so you know everybody calm down with the we're gonna die because the transactions are low. Did Hal Finney is a hero of mine. I you know, he's dead and there's no chance I'm ever gonna meet him. But man, I wish I could have interviewed him. Second to Satoshi, I believe he's had more good ideas in terms of Bitcoin and done more to move it along than anyone else. 

Does that make sense? I mean, I Yeah. I don't care you Andre and others. I don't care. I I don't care. You can look at like, he just said random little things like, one day, I see, like, private banks that you can put your Bitcoin in and and you mean like eCash? Like cashew? Like, Fetamin? You know? And that was just like almost an off the cuff remark. The fact that I mean, he was a brilliant programmer and oh, man. Anyways. 

[00:22:18] Kenshin:

Was it Yeah. Was it him? Again, I we talked about it last year, but was it him or or Satoshi saying it it might go to zero or to a million or whatever. So you might as well get some was him. 

I I think it was Halfin. Yeah. He might mix just to get some in case his catches on. That was February. Wait. Oh, no. It was Nakamoto. Was it? Yeah. It might make sense just to get some encased catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. But I remember, I think it was Hal Finis saying something So Yeah. Dramatic numbers. He 

[00:23:05] McIntosh:

predicted a million dollar Bitcoin when it was only a dollar. This was February 1030. Bitcoin has the potential to become the dominant currency worldwide. If this happens, Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars each. That was February 1030. 

Right. And that was just the kind of Yeah. Visionary he 

[00:23:27] Kenshin:

Yeah. 

[00:23:32] McIntosh:

Yeah. And which sounds absurd at the time. Right? It was Yeah. It's a dollar. Crazy. Bitcoin's a dollar. It's it's what are we doing here, you know? Alright. The the other the other news item moderately important, did wanna point out. We got a few other things that would go under software. But the other news item we've got is about Bitcoin Core. Not really my favorite topic, but we're going to I think this needs to be relayed. There was a bug that came out that's been determined that affects Bitcoin core 30 and core 30.1. 

And I'll just read this email. It comes from Ava Chow. It was actually just put out today, I think. Although this is I've heard stuff about this for a couple of days. Anyways, it says, hi, all. We have become aware of a wallet migration bug introduced in Bitcoin Core thirty point zero and thirty point one. Under rare circumstances, when the migration of a wallet.dat files fails, all files in the wallet directory may be deleted in the process, potentially resulting in the loss of funds. A fix is forthcoming and will be released as 30 dot two. They have pulled the binaries for those two releases from bitcoincore.org. 

They do not they're they say you should not attempt wallet migrations until 30.2 is released, etcetera etcetera. Pretty sobering. Yeah. I I'll just leave it at that and I I've become way too close to that situation to to be objective about it anymore, to be honest. So I'm just gonna stop. 

[00:25:20] Kenshin:

There was go ahead. Sorry. Yeah. But but I would say it sounds like it's it's very specific to Yes. The GUI software. If you have Bitcoin Core 30 or 30.1 and you're using the GUI version of the wallet and you do a migration on that GUI Yep. 

[00:25:45] McIntosh:

And I I don't know who who does that. But I don't know. But Yeah. Just be careful Yeah. Out of an abundance of caution. 

Unfortunately, there's another one that I feel like is even worse. And if you've listened to this podcast, I don't think I've ever had a different opinion about this. Maybe I have at some point. I guess I did early on. But for a long time, I felt like Ledger was not a legitimate, you know, they they just it's not good. Well, January 5, so just a day or two ago, they've confirmed that their ecommerce partner Global e experienced a data breach affecting customer information. However, the company has reassured users that their crypto wallets and digital assets remain secure and uncompromised. 

Ledger emphasized its commitment to safeguarding customer assets despite the incident involving the third party service provider. So here's the problem, ladies and gentlemen. This this hacker or hackers got ahold of the Ledger data involving you if you're a customer of theirs, and potentially they have your name, your address, and potentially even your Bitcoin amount. It's it's possible. I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying it's possible. So you may get targeted scam, emails, phone calls about your Ledger setup. Does that make sense? It's happened with Ledger before. It's happened again. It will happen again if they continue to stay in business and continue to do what they do. 



[00:27:29] Kenshin:

The it's it's this modern way of sharing with third parties all the data. Right. 

[00:27:36] McIntosh:

You know, I complain bitterly about Ledger because they put every casino coin under the sun in the ledger wallet. Like you can do that. You can store Ethereum, Solana. Don't know. I don't even beyond that I don't even know. Whatever. That's all an attack surface. And it's the same thing when they start, oh, hey. You take care of this piece of our business process. You do this. You do that. Because we don't have the manpower, the time, or the talent maybe to do that. You're exposing your attack surface. And the problem is to have the business model that they have, they have to do this stuff because they sell a piece of hardware. 

I don't know. Anyways, if you're using Ledger get off of it. That's all I can tell you. Mhmm. Alright. Good. What's the next? Oh, let's let me double check. Sorry. I've got to get a better way of getting stuff from my phone to our notes. Unfortunately, I really don't. So that's why I'm a little bit messy here. I I do have two different software updates, but that'll be later. Ledger. Oh, I did wanna throw this out. Well, that'll go under software. Software. There's actually more than two software. Okay. Hey, Kenshin. Let's talk about predictions. 

2026. I think in general, let's break this down a little bit. I think you got some nice you got some nice divisions here. We will talk about Bitcoin first. So I see you have converted to the dark side. Yeah. And you are now bullish. So let's talk about it. Well What made you change your mind? 

[00:29:46] Kenshin:

Well, I've saying that we are in in that pattern for not not the four year pattern that everybody's been saying, that everybody says is broken. Mhmm. The pattern of the highs and lows and the weeks between that. With still a four year pattern but in weeks measuring And that pattern holds true, which says that October 6 was the top. 

Right. And the next and that was the last top of this cycle. And the next cycle is the bear market with a low In October. In October '26. '26, which would make this a bear mark a bear year. Right. Right? So how are you bullish? So now my my prediction I I I don't know. New year, new me. I don't know. Don't know. It's just if if it ever breaks, it might break now. I mean, we have so much pressure from the Fiat system and gold is breaking highs and the silver. If everything goes well and nothing catastrophic happens and no reason for global economy to go down, then I think that it will be too much pressure to pull Bitcoin up. 



[00:31:12] McIntosh:

So I So you didn't even talk about the fact that a lot of people believe that The United States is gonna start printing a bunch of money this year? 

[00:31:23] Kenshin:

No. I that not even that. I I think Do you think that's significant? Or I think it's significant. I just don't know the timing. I mean, the timing can take a year, right, until that takes a real effect to see Bitcoin go up. That that didn't matter for me even last year when we were talking about it. So now now I'm just thinking a bit more positive ahead for '26, which is maybe it's my hope, not not realistic. We always know what happens when Right. When you predict that the pattern will break and it doesn't. 



[00:31:58] McIntosh:

Okay? So Samson Mao. Oh, sorry. It hasn't seemed to hurt him. That's the funny thing. People who get out here make just crazy ridiculous. I mean he predicted a million dollar bitcoin 2020 if I'm not mistaken and obviously that didn't happen. Yeah. Trying to be Well, welcome to the dark side. Yeah. There's plenty of room over here. 

[00:32:26] Kenshin:

Oh, and I would say something else because I told you because I'm DCA ing, right? Mhmm. So and every now and then, I take an opportunity if I have something more on the side to Right. Convert to Bitcoin. So I did that also. So I I put my money 

[00:32:45] McIntosh:

do Where your mouth is? 

Exactly. Your money where your mouth is. Very good. I I I stuck extra these 

[00:32:51] Kenshin:

vacations. 

[00:32:53] McIntosh:

Well, in general, I agree with you. I think The US side of things might actually factor into this more than maybe you would think or like. Maybe. I'm not sure. I do know the midterms are coming up here in The United States. So that's in November, a new round of elections for the house people and some of the senate people. I guess it's some of each. Anyways, Trump is very intent on maintaining Trump is very intent on maintaining control of the House and the Senate and he's gonna spend money to do that. 

He has no problem spending money. I do believe it's been a little bit delayed. A lot of people kind of thought this was gonna start back in October and clearly that didn't hasn't happened. There have been indications the Fed is doing these and it's not reverse repo. I can't remember what it is but you know they're they're doing things to inject liquidity into the market. This stuff is starting to happen. We know we're gonna have a new Fed chair in May, think it is it March or May? It starts with an m. Maybe it's March because I think it seems like it's sooner rather than later. But regardless, there'll be a new Fed chair this year. 

And if Trump gets his way, it will be someone who will immediately raise or lower rates by half a percent, if not more. Mhmm. You know, he wants those rates down and he feels like you can just manipulate it like I don't have a good analogy but he just feels like you can manipulate that market no matter what. It doesn't matter what happens, you know, he doesn't unemployment, whatever, it it doesn't just get the rate down and that's going to create a new round of spending and so on and so forth. Until we get above a 126 I'm not convinced but that's still my thesis and just like you I'm buying bitcoin every week. 

Just bought some more with strike and it doesn't matter to me whether it goes up or goes down. If it goes down, if it were to really go down I would buy as much as I could but it's not done that at this point. I'm buying as much as I feel like I can. I don't know. I think we're pretty much on the same thing though. That's interesting. 

[00:35:38] Kenshin:

Yeah. But per personally, I I don't want to put too much hope on US whatever strategies or tactics or Trump promises or because we did that last year and basically nothing that 

[00:35:55] McIntosh:

we hoped for happened last year. Trying to predict Trump is like I that's a gamble. I'm not taken. 

He does whatever he wants. Yeah. And he'll tell you whatever he wants. For me, I hope irrespective 

[00:36:09] Kenshin:

of US, unless US something does something bad, that could take us to a real bear market. Yeah. Which we kind of are already but 

[00:36:21] McIntosh:

Well, we still have issues in Japan. We still have issues in China. I believe I'm not convinced otherwise. Japan is very obvious. The carry trade is over because they've started raising interest rates. There's a lot of issues going on in the world and any one of those really could topple us into what amounts to a global recession. 

Yay. That's that's thoughtful. That's 

[00:36:53] Kenshin:

Yeah. Exactly. I mean there are so many things that could happen. Right. 

[00:36:58] McIntosh:

Yeah. You know us USA people, feel like we gotta lead the way. Yeah. Alright. What's your second one there? 

[00:37:08] Kenshin:

Well, then I was looking a bit more of European Mhmm. News, let's say. And there is a lot of talk last from last year about the EU. 

[00:37:21] McIntosh:

Yes. Is 

[00:37:23] Kenshin:

that even coming out in '20 they were trialing it in '26. Is that what okay. Yeah. It's supposed to come out now in '26. Great. I don't have the details. Maybe I can prepare some more details for next time, but I heard it I heard some promises they promised again for for this year. You you know why they're doing this. This is to directly compete. 



[00:37:46] McIntosh:

Have we talked about this? Yeah. This is to directly compete with the euro dollar, which is really US dollars over in Europe. 

[00:37:55] Kenshin:

Yeah. Not even that, to compete with Visa and MasterCard themselves. Yeah. To take out those middle companies that are huge. Which I 

[00:38:07] McIntosh:

find ironic because if companies are smart, they would move not towards something like this. They would move towards a lightning based network, for example, something like Square. Is is yeah. It's Square where they've enabled Bitcoin payments. For right now, the fees are zero. They will eventually raise them, but, you know, 1%, 2% maybe. It's still gonna be less than Visa and Mastercard. 



[00:38:38] Kenshin:

Yeah. I think we're a bit too early for that. But, yeah, it will be nice if that goes mainstream. 

[00:38:44] McIntosh:

There's a lot of companies out there using that. There's a website where it shows where it's enabled, and I don't know what that is offhand. Maybe I can look it up. But Yeah. It was around 4,000,000 

[00:38:54] Kenshin:

merchants. 

[00:38:55] McIntosh:

That's a lot of people. 

[00:38:57] Kenshin:

Yeah. Yeah. I I remember that that number when they came out with Bitcoin news, they said now 4,000,000 merchants can accept Bitcoin essentially. So 

[00:39:09] McIntosh:

if the e euro or whatever you wanna call it fails, what how is that going to affect Europe? 

The EU specifically, I guess. How is that gonna affect the EU? I Does it just fail and go away and that's just it's kind of a minor blip or is this gonna be a major problem? Oh, it's gonna be a major problem. I mean, because 

[00:39:36] Kenshin:

the European Central Bank specifically is putting all their eggs in that basket. They're spending, I think, billions of years actually to fund this how do we say, fund the development and to fund companies to start using it and testing it. How hard? Okay. So they're putting a lot of money and capacity behind it. I just hope again, I don't know, probably it's not gonna fail. I just again, hope there, 

[00:40:04] McIntosh:

they can't. 



[00:40:05] Kenshin:

Yeah. I just hope it fails. Yeah. Because yeah. Then we start down that path. Yeah. That's they will see every transaction, of course, like they already can with the bank transactions, but even more now with smaller transactions, everyday transactions. And, yeah, I don't know where that can lead, but now we're good. 

[00:40:29] McIntosh:

So we don't have a central bank digital currency issue per se. Not like that. But I would say in general, The US, I actually think in the end this is gonna be a quote good year. We're still gonna have inflation. Things are still gonna go up. It's housing and because of other things that I do I'm familiar with housing. 

Housing is outrageous. Like new and we've talked we've mentioned this stuff in passing on here. New home buyers, the age is getting higher and higher because people can't afford houses. Right. Even starter houses much less, you know, nice houses. Yeah. But I think we're gonna see the unleashing of and this is kind of my thesis, the spending of money, the the printing of money, the governmental spending, the you know, it because Trump doesn't care about deficits. Trump doesn't care about any of that. He just wants to he thinks we can he and maybe he does believe this or maybe this is just what he says. He believes we can grow our way out of this. AI and robotics are gonna solve all this so we're just gonna spend money. 

That's basically in a nutshell what he has said multiple times. And that's not gonna work in the long term but for 2026 and maybe beyond, we're gonna be rolling in the money and the people who take advantage of that are gonna do very well. Unfortunately, the the vast majority of poor people and middle class people are not and that's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. They're just gonna see the inflation. They're just gonna see the downside of all of this. So, you know, I'm trying to position myself personally to benefit from what I see coming and that doesn't mean I'm going out and buying more gold and silver. 

I don't own any gold. I think I've said before I have a little bit of silver. I try and be very transparent with you guys but I haven't bought any in years, a long time. But I do believe that there will be people who will benefit from all of this because I do believe that silver is gonna go up unlike mister Jack who said a couple weeks ago, it's we've reached the top. We've already gone past that but okay. Because it to me, like I told you prior to the show, in my mind, gold and silver are the best assets after bitcoin because of because of their qualities. 

And I don't dismiss that. Silver has a long history of problems or whatever but silver not only does it have ability as currency, it is used in industry much more than gold actually is. So from that standpoint it should be doing better than gold and it has been for the last year or so roughly but we will see if that continues. But it's a perfect conductor, like a so called perfect conductor of electricity, for example. So they use it in a lot of electronic components. I don't know. I'm doing things to try and benefit from what I view as this coming inflation cycle but a lot of people can't. The people who are living paycheck to paycheck, you know, who are barely getting by, they're just following even more behind and it's very concerning to me. 

Okay. That's it on that. Now what about our personal stuff? You wanna go there? 

[00:44:49] Kenshin:

Yeah. Well, 

[00:44:50] McIntosh:

that that's what I hinted earlier. I can't believe you're telling all this. This is shocking. 

[00:44:57] Kenshin:

No. I'm I'm again targeting personally for Fiat Freedom next year. No. This year. 

[00:45:04] McIntosh:

This year. 

[00:45:06] Kenshin:

We're very close. Just as long as we understand it's not from this podcast. No. It's not from a podcast. No. Definitely not. Oh, man. It's my my personal project with my wife that actually, it's a Fiat business. It's gonna be a fiat business. 

[00:45:22] McIntosh:

Well gonna be our own business. You are gonna be able to take Bitcoin in the end. Right? I mean, I know you won't take euros or whatever. But Yes. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Once Sweden wakes up I wouldn't call it a fiat business. 



[00:45:36] Kenshin:

No. But I I mean, it's not gonna be Bitcoin related to start with. The income will still be Swedish kronor, basically. So but we're forward to that. I mean, I'm I'm working day and night these these past few weeks and really, really trying to get it out. And the big revelation this time has been I talked to you a bit about it. Right. It's been amazing to code. This is my first effort with Chargepti, Charge so I don't have any prior experience with it. I was primarily with Claude for the last six months or so. Right? Since, I don't know, April, May. So going to Charge GPT, it's everything that I hoped for an AI coding wise to be. 

Okay. Yeah. So I think I think I'm very close. I'm actually correcting a lot of mistakes that Claude had made. 

[00:46:48] McIntosh:

That's funny. 

[00:46:51] Kenshin:

Yeah. And a bit annoying because it's still keep going back to to sections of the code that I thought they were good. And even small read me and documentation files Mhmm. That are outdated for six months with some some architecture decision I made and it was not even reflected in the documentation which I asked It never got updated. To fix many times. I said, bring the documentation up today. And then all of a sudden, just GPT I I just saw it just fixed the 

[00:47:23] McIntosh:

used to ChatGPT and they'll put out Yeah. Two versions from now, you know, Claude, and it'll blow it all away. As long as it keeps getting better, that's all that matters. 



[00:47:35] Kenshin:

Honestly, I don't need anything better right now. All I need is more time, more usage because I actually hit the weekly limit in three days or let's say four days. So for three days I couldn't use my account but I can But you have been offline. 

[00:47:53] McIntosh:

Like not offline. You've been away from your job just doing this continuously. So that's not normal usage for you. 

[00:48:03] Kenshin:

No. It's not. So I think with normal half day or Right. Two hours a day usage, that's fine. I don't hit the weekly limit. Yeah. Right. 

[00:48:12] McIntosh:

And with that I haven't not set it back up yet. I'm going to I've already decided I'm gonna do what you're doing and see how that goes because I've got some little projects like the Satoshi's website which I need to finish up, you know, things like that and I thought it'd be a good chance for that. Yeah. Yeah. It does sound like it's doing substantially better than Claude is these days. Although, I swear, I remember a time and it wasn't even that long ago, Claude was doing much better. It just seems like I don't know what happens. I don't I don't understand why they kinda go backwards. 



[00:48:52] Kenshin:

It it was very clear. In August, it it was crushing all the time. The the servers were crushing all the time. Mhmm. So they had to to lower the output or input to Claude. And from that point on, even my wife, that she has no clue about coding, she she was telling me, it's stupid. It it doesn't it's literally stupid. It doesn't work anymore. And that was my experience. And it kept assuming, 

[00:49:24] McIntosh:

guessing instead of reading the good. It keeps Or doing the same thing over and over, which that just drives me nuts. Nuts. Have we done this? Well, yes. Actually, five minutes ago, you told me to do that and I did it and that's the result and you're an idiot, computer. 



[00:49:39] Kenshin:

Sorry. And the most important part, you know, you have this agent dot m d or clods dot m d with the instructions in the code base. So in that file, have the instruction how Claude should behave and Essentially. Check your Yeah. And you're saying that setup is like never guess, always double check the code, and, yeah, do the best practices, decision, blah blah blah. You have a lot of things like that. So when Claude started guessing, I asked I said, please don't guess again. Put it in your instructions. Okay. I will put it in my instructions. Then it goes to the instructions and says, oh, actually, we already have it in the instructions. What? I I said, why if we have it in the instructions, why are you guessing? And it it it said, okay. I will not guess anymore. 

Moving on to write the next task five minutes New task. Okay. Let's work on this now. Yeah. And it did the same thing. And I said, wait. Why did you introduce this bug? Did you guess? Where did this come from? It's like, oh, yes. I guessed again. I did the same mistake. And it it was very honest admitting that it it made the same mistake over and over again by just guessing instead of Right. Checking the code. Alright. It was infuriating. 

[00:51:01] McIntosh:

So Well, AI success this year with Claude. We wish that upon you, sir. Not Claude. Chat GPT. 

[00:51:09] Kenshin:

Sorry. Yeah. If it doesn't if it stays as it is, I am super happy. I can do everything I need to do and we will be live very soon. I do think it will be interesting 

[00:51:22] McIntosh:

to see where all this stuff goes in the future. I just don't know. I I don't know if this whole thing is a viable business model. I'd we'll see. Ten years from now we'll know. 

Alright. So for me personally, I I debated saying this. I'm going to go ahead and say it. I do have a goal this year personally, and it's it's to leave my job, not for Fiat Freedom as yourself. I just as far as I know, I've only given my podcast out to a couple of people that I work with, and I'm pretty sure neither one of them listen to this. So I'm just gonna say this. I've been there for eight years and it's been about six years too long to be not six years, about two years too long. I'm tired, I'm burned out, I'm frustrated And to be honest, I don't feel like I can move ahead in my job anymore which is not where you wanna be. 

And I really frankly wanna leave the computer business behind and do other things. I want to build or run other businesses. And my wife and I my wife specifically is working on some other things that I would like to spend more time working with her on and leave my job. The problem is my job does, you know, the economy's terrible in terms of the computer industry. I am getting paid obviously and I don't wanna leave that behind. So it's I don't know. But I gotta put down a marker somewhere, and I would like to say that, you know, by the end of this year that I'm no longer there, however that shapes out. 

So I'll say that. I would love to be doing better at AI as well. I really think I need to get onto chat GPT myself. And I did wanna throw out a third thing. You guys, if you've listened to this podcast long enough, you know, I know Kenshin knows. My personality, whatever you wanna call it, it's not my personality, but I come up with ideas constantly. And I'm just like, pew pew pew pew. And do this, do this, do this. And many of which I actually start and then end up stopping. I don't get very far into it. I would like to see a little more follow through, maybe fewer ideas, maybe better ideas, I don't know, with more follow through, whether it's in regards to things for this podcast or, you know, personal things, whatever. 

So I'll just go ahead and say that on here. I don't know if that's what that means, but I will say that. So you get to hold me accountable, Kenshin. The next time I say, hey, we should do this. You should say, okay, Cowboys, slow down. Think about what you're saying. I don't know. Yeah. And I have some other personal goals frankly myself which I don't think I'm gonna share on here. I'm sorry. Yeah. 

[00:54:56] Kenshin:

It's it's harder than it sounds. Right? Isn't it? I mean, the one year passed so fast, and I also had so many. Just so many Just 

[00:55:07] McIntosh:

wait. 

Just you wait. I will tell you this grasshopper. The older you get the faster it goes. And that's part of my problem. There are things in my life I want to do. And to be honest, my window of opportunity, if you wanna call it that, is getting less and less. Right? You could always tell the story, well, colonel Sanders didn't start Kentucky Fried Chicken until he was in his sixties. Yes. And he was very exceptional. Not saying that you can't, but, you know, when you're 20 it's one thing. When you're 30 it's one thing. But once you get past 30 things start life pulls you different directions and you don't understand that when you're 20 and 30. 

But there are anyways Yeah. And you want to have time to enjoy that. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I've had this dream for years. I mean, I'll I'll just say this of having a buffalo ranch, you know, which sounds crazy to 99.9% of y'all and that's okay. That's what I want. I want a buffalo ranch. I don't wanna be 70 years old when I get it. Does that make sense? Yeah. Because buffalo is a 2,000 pound beast. You don't wanna be 70 years old out there dealing with one of them. 

[00:56:39] Kenshin:

Yeah. No. Suspects. 

[00:56:43] McIntosh:

You know, I don't know. Sorry. That got a little philosophical, I guess, but there you go. 

Supporters, sadly, this week, the last two weeks, we have not had any. I just think we're in a cycle where price is down, it's the holidays. I don't know. That's just where we're at. We are going to soldier on. I'm about to buy a pretty doggone expensive microphone on the hopes that we continue doing this. Yeah. Oh, I actually I have one more for personal. Can I throw this out? Sorry. That reminded me And this is really crazy. And this goes back to literally what I was just talking about. But this is something I've wanted to do for a long time. 2026, I do want to did this turn into a these aren't predictions. Predictions. These These are are like what are we gonna do? I don't know. Well, whatever. Alright. I really wanted to start a Tolkien podcast which I know that sounds stupid but 

[00:57:48] Kenshin:

Oh yeah. 



[00:57:50] McIntosh:

You know, I'm no Tolkien scholar but I read him, I wanna say religiously but that sounds bad. I've read entire stacks of books around how he wrote his stories stories and around him and I believe I have something to bring. Now we'll we'll see. And that does mean I have to have time to do it and that's a problem. So we'll see But I haven't officially made it a goal yet, but I sure would like to. We'll see. And and another thing I'm debating about then is do I do it under this name, or do I do it under my real name or what? Because if I do it under my real name then I can never talk about it on this podcast. 

So 

[00:58:42] Kenshin:

Right. And then with AI we can find you and cross check the voice. 

[00:58:48] McIntosh:

I will probably just keep it under this name. That's really what I'm leaning to because I've gotten so used to saying it anyways, it doesn't matter unless I have a cohost which I'm thinking about maybe one of my sons but I'm not sure he would wanna do it anyway. So he of course, he's not gonna be calling me by my first name anyways. So he better not. 

[00:59:14] Kenshin:

Well, at least he can call you dad, I guess. 

[00:59:19] McIntosh:

I don't know. We'll see. So for our question this week, Kenshin, why don't we do this? What are your predictions for 2026? Boost on in and let us know. 

And should we throw a crazy prize ourselves? Or Oh, we didn't do oh gosh. Okay. You first because you're the one who's flipped the script. 

[00:59:44] Kenshin:

I I was a lot more confident with the price prediction this time last year. I mean, now I have no clue. I mean, if the pattern continues, my prediction is, what is it in dollars, like 72 k? Wait. That's going down. If the pattern holds Yeah. But Oh. If if I take my my newly optimistic Mhmm. Self 

[01:00:15] McIntosh:

I'm following you. 

[01:00:16] Kenshin:

Yeah. Then I must say Yeah. 175. 

[01:00:24] McIntosh:

Oh. I'll go higher. If we break $1.26 or whatever the all time high was I think we go almost teleport to 200. 

I mean I'd I'd if if that happens in the first half of the year we're at 200 before the end of the year. And that's my prediction and I will regret saying that. Thank you very much. Right there on m p three. Right there on tape. Can't say that anymore. Alright? 

[01:00:53] Kenshin:

Yeah. Has there ever been a prediction correct with Bitcoin price? Ever. 

[01:01:00] McIntosh:

Well Hal Finney's is still out there. He said it could go to millions. I mean, but he didn't give a date. You see, he was a smart guy. Right. Alright. I got a few software updates I wanna throw out here before we wrap up and we do need to wrap up. Somehow we've managed to make this a long episode. I'm not sure how. Yeah. 

I wanna give a shout out. I believe he listens to this podcast, but he isn't one of our followers on on Oster. The bullish bitcoiner put out a new version of his, what would you call this? You know what I'm talking about? It's like a he's hosting bitcoin businesses. I'm not exactly sure because I don't have one to put on there. What the deal is it's called Take My Sats. A bitcoin only ecommerce platform. So that's what he technically calls it. I don't know exactly but if you have your own business where you're selling Bitcoin product you might wanna take a look at this. It's version zero dot thirty eight dot zero. I think the idea is it's like Shopify and you can build into your system, into your website like a shopping cart kind of thing and then he handles all the back end of that and you pay him for it. He also does these promotions which come up every few weeks. I don't know if you've seen that on Noster. 

It's like what would you call that? 

[01:02:38] Kenshin:

Wait. 

[01:02:40] McIntosh:

Yeah. Where it's like a bizarre kind of thing. You know what I mean? Like a marketplace. A marketplace. Yeah. Yeah. So he's got some things going on there. If you are in a Bitcoin only business, I would highly suggest that you follow him. It's the bullish bitcoiner over on Noster. You can look him up. Okay. A couple of other things real quick. I saw a really cool thing. The Kansas City Bitcoiners have a dedicated website for their bitcoin meetup. This is something a lot of bitcoin meetups don't have and they have it on GitHub And they have it fully integrated like with meetup.com or whatever that website is that I hate so much. Meet meetup? 

Anyways, that commercial website that everybody uses for meetings. But basically, they've done they've done a lot of the hard work. If you have a bitcoin meetup site, you should go visit it and take a look at it. It's the k c dash bitcoiners website and it's on github. You could Google that and find it easily enough. It'd be a great way if you don't already have a website to put one up. You basically make a few changes to some configs and you can get it up and running. They put a lot of work into it it looks like. Coinswap has a new version and that's a pretty big deal if you're involved in that 0.2 .zero. 

And then there was one more at least. Oh, come on. I repost too much stuff. We've already talked about that. Zeus zero dot 12 dot one beta. So that version 12 is now in beta. If you're using that, you should take a look at that and that's it. Mhmm. 

[01:04:35] Kenshin:

Zeus 

[01:04:36] McIntosh:

is very cool. What is it? I like Zeus. I need to I need to use it more. Alright. Our price at type of recording, 91,180 US dollars, which is actually down for the day, sadly. What do we got in euros, sir? 

[01:04:52] Kenshin:

€78,000, but I think it's dropping as we speak. So think it's around 76. We'll leave it at 78. 

[01:04:59] McIntosh:

We're optimistic here. 

Price last January 7 was $96.09 32, so almost 97,000. We're down six roughly 6%, 5.9% cents. You wanna do the market cap? 

[01:05:15] Kenshin:

Yeah. Bitcoin's market cap is at 1,800,000,000,000.0 USD and gold's market cap on the other hand is at 31,000,000,000,000 exactly which brings us to 5.9% Bitcoin versus gold. So in the low yeah. We haven't seen 5% for a while. So we were up to 10 over 10. Yep. So 

[01:05:41] McIntosh:

I remember those days. 

[01:05:43] Kenshin:

Sounds like a good time to stack if you ask me. 

[01:05:46] McIntosh:

Yeah. It could be. It could be. I'm gonna I'm gonna send my friend Trump a message and say, dude, you gotta start buying some Bitcoin for that reserve. 

[01:05:56] Kenshin:

Yeah. 



[01:05:57] McIntosh:

Oh my gosh. I'm not friends with Trump by the way, people. That's a joke. Y'all gotta catch my humor. Know Kenshin struggles with it. He's 

[01:06:09] Kenshin:

but 

[01:06:10] McIntosh:

you're American. All Americans are friends with Trump. Right? Yeah. Know. He invites us over every Thursday. We have a standing invitation. Mempool fees, sadly, are only 0.2 sats per V byte, which is disgusting. Alright. And 72,000 unprocessed transactions right now, and that's about 228 megabytes. So Mhmm. Slow, low, whatever. I I got a question. Do you think that this is because more has gone to the Lightning Network or things in general are slower? 



[01:06:48] Kenshin:

I mean, I have Or both? No. I I don't know. It's very interesting because if you look back, we had those times before with the same amount of traffic. Mhmm. But it was never that low, so I don't know. It might have to do with the value of Bitcoin. So that the value of Bitcoin is higher than 

[01:07:09] McIntosh:

a few years ago when we had the same As of right now, we got a lot of room to grow. I don't know. Oh, wow. I just saw this data. This is news on me. No distributions. Yeah. 24,535. So that is up a significant amount in the last few months. I know the last time I saw it, it was 24,000. So I know it broke 24,000. 

That was a big deal. Well, now we're halfway to 25. But Bitcoin Core is at 78%. Bitcoin Nachs is actually up to 21.85%. Mhmm. So it climbed about a percent, almost 2% in the last few weeks. Yeah. It's interesting. Interesting. 

[01:07:52] Kenshin:

Time for holidays, people are installing new nodes. 

[01:07:55] McIntosh:

Everybody's always like, oh, you could just spin those up on a like who wants to just spin up a node and have it sit there? Man, this stuff costs money. Yeah. If you're just like spinning up a 100 of these just to boost some statistics, you and I need to be friends and you need to start start spending money on me. 

[01:08:16] Kenshin:

Okay? Yeah. Just the hard drives. Yeah. 

They're expensive. Wow. 

[01:08:22] McIntosh:

I don't know. Anyways, maybe that is what's going on. I don't maybe these bitcoin whales sit around and do this stuff. I don't know. I'm not one. I'm not even a shrimp. Wait. I guess I am a shrimp. Yeah. Anyway. Hopefully you're That's the lowest level. Right? 

[01:08:38] Kenshin:

Okay. That's the smallest level. 

[01:08:41] McIntosh:

I lost all my bitcoin on the boat last summer, Kenshin. 

[01:08:45] Kenshin:

You have the boosts. 

[01:08:48] McIntosh:

Okay. We got $200 of bitcoin. That's it between the two of us. That is literally what's in there.

Satoshi's Plebs. 

We gotta bring this on. Satoshi's Plebs is a value for value podcast supporting podcasting two point o. We strive to bring you honest Bitcoin content every week. We ask, are you getting value for this show? Support it through time, talent, or treasure. You can stream sats and boost with messages, even a 100 sats saying great show or you suck, we'll read it. Either way, check out the apps at podcastapps.com and support independent bitcoin media. If you'd like the content, I would love it if you would write a review on Apple and tell your friends about the podcast. That will help us a lot, please. This week's music for the last time is gonna be Race or Why number two by my favorite band and that is the actual band name ladies and gentlemen. It is not my favorite band although they're really good. 

That is their name. Any I wonder if they regret that, by the way. Any boost or streaming of stats during that song will go straight to the artist.

Bye bye.
