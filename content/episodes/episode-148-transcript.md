McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, Sats Stackers.

00:00:02This is

00:00:03the last episode

00:00:05of Generation Bitcoin,

00:00:07episode

00:00:08one forty eight. This is your host, Macintosh.

00:00:12So let's get to it.

00:00:43Alright. So this is gonna be a little bit different, for a couple of reasons. First of all, this is the last episode Generation Bitcoin. In just a few minutes, I'll tell what the name of the new

00:00:53podcast will be when it comes out in January. We've discussed this a lot, so I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time on it, but I will be announcing that very shortly.

00:01:03I had something happen yesterday, and it's thrown me for a loop, which is probably why my

00:01:08intro was off.

00:01:11I use Umbrel. I've used the Umbrel for a while,

00:01:14for a fair amount for, I don't know, probably at least a year.

00:01:18And last night, I had a partition

00:01:22die,

00:01:23specifically. I actually think I had a a hard drive itself die,

00:01:27and it looks like it's unrecoverable.

00:01:29And your lovable host here did not do his due diligence even though he knew better

00:01:36and he didn't have backups.

00:01:38So,

00:01:40the worst thing I lost was probably a 100,000,

00:01:43sats,

00:01:45on a lightning node that he had set up, but I also just realized

00:01:50Trillium

00:01:52notes were on there as well in the long run. That may actually

00:01:57prove

00:01:58more painful. So I literally have no notes for this.

00:02:03So if I

00:02:04don't get things correct,

00:02:07I wanna blame it on that, and we'll move on. So this is going to be a fairly short episode.

00:02:13This will be the last episode

00:02:15until the start of next year when I will be kicking off

00:02:19Satoshi's Plebs podcast. I have

00:02:23registered,

00:02:25Satoshis

00:02:26dash plebs,

00:02:27plebs plural,

00:02:30and Satoshi, like, it's Satoshi's possessive, so it's satoshi

00:02:35s

00:02:36Dash Clubs.

00:02:37So that's what we're going to do, and

00:02:41I spent quite a bit of time trying to come up with a name. I have dozens,

00:02:45well, at least a dozen different domain names that I could have registered.

00:02:51But I'm I'm very pleased with this, and there's a reason why.

00:02:55Of course, Satoshi Satoshi Nakamoto

00:02:57who was the pseudononymous,

00:03:00creator

00:03:01of Bitcoin,

00:03:02the founder,

00:03:03the

00:03:04the person who led the project

00:03:06until he disappeared

00:03:08a few years

00:03:10in, said that he was leaving

00:03:12and that was it. Kind of this apocryphal story almost at this point. So I'm very disappointed

00:03:18about my

00:03:20I'm very disappointed about my Trillium. I'm actually more

00:03:24disappointed about that than than

00:03:26the 100,000 sats. Although, in the long run, I may regret the sats.

00:03:32They should be returned

00:03:33to the main chain.

00:03:35That's the way that lightning works when things get forced closed.

00:03:39Satoshi's Plebs. Yes. Satoshis-plebs.com.

00:03:45It is not up as I make this podcast,

00:03:48and this will be put out later today, but it will be up before January 1st. I will get something going,

00:03:54on there. I will move this

00:03:57podcast over

00:03:59to,

00:04:00CastOS,

00:04:02my CastOS setup,

00:04:04from Captivate.

00:04:06And so there we go.

00:04:09Yeah.

00:04:11So looking forward to that, looking forward to the new podcast.

00:04:15I have always been, as you know, about plebs, about the common person, if you wanna call it that.

00:04:23To me, brick Bitcoin is free to money that that

00:04:27absolutely

00:04:28can help clubs.

00:04:30People

00:04:31like in Argentina,

00:04:34where they have

00:04:35144%

00:04:36inflation,

00:04:38currently,

00:04:39and,

00:04:40you know, that punishes the people who live out in the countryside, so to speak, who aren't

00:04:46technocrats, who don't, you know,

00:04:48they don't, have a whole lot of Internet knowledge in this kind of thing. They can't buy you you they can't trade for US dollars

00:04:58to keep some value

00:05:00when their currency continues to devaluate.

00:05:03Bitcoin is freedom money in the sense to them

00:05:07that even though Bitcoin is volatile, I promise you it's less volatile than the Argentine Peso right now or the Turkish lyra or the, Lebanon,

00:05:16currency. I don't know what it is.

00:05:19Or probably a few other places around the world right now.

00:05:23And there's so many other ways that Bitcoin

00:05:26helps the common person, the pleb. Does it help, you know,

00:05:31is it going to help

00:05:33BlackRock,

00:05:34when their ETF gets approved, absolutely,

00:05:37those people are not plebs,

00:05:39but it will help the plebs.

00:05:41It'll help the people who

00:05:43don't have banking services. Otherwise, the unbanked. There's so many people in the world who do not have banks, and

00:05:50Bitcoin is literally a way to solve that problem. Alright.

00:05:56Block height, that time of recording. Let me

00:06:00do this real quick. Gonna go to mempool.space.

00:06:04Actually, I want to go to time chain calendar.

00:06:08We'll go there real quick, and we'll take a look at the markets. We're at 819-165.

00:06:14That's

00:06:15819,165.

00:06:18We are now officially 90% of the way to the next halvening,

00:06:23which will occur in late April.

00:06:26Our previous adjustment happened just a few days ago. I think I may have actually said this last time, but it was 5.07%.

00:06:34Right now, we are actually looking at a downward adjustment, 3.69%.

00:06:38That would happen on December 2nd,

00:06:41and, that is because all of a sudden, for whatever reason, block times are now 10 minutes and 23 seconds on average.

00:06:49So the difficulty is set to adjust downward

00:06:52to account for that.

00:06:54And right now, actually,

00:06:57you know, fees

00:06:58are okay.

00:07:00Priority is 36. Anytime is 22 sets per v byte, so that's actually much better

00:07:07than it has been. We are still at 1.3 gigabytes

00:07:10of

00:07:11mempool.

00:07:12So a lot of transactions out there.

00:07:19Alright. The last block that was mined was 6.619

00:07:23seven in total subsidy plus fees, and that went, unfortunately,

00:07:28to Ant Poole

00:07:30instead of my beloved brains.

00:07:35Brains, made a big announcement actually yesterday.

00:07:38There was a few mining announcements

00:07:41this week, but they are moving

00:07:43to

00:07:44a different form of reward structure. I think they call it FPP or F p p p, something like that. Here it is. Actually, there's their announcement

00:07:55coming in December.

00:07:57And what that means,

00:08:00FPPs,

00:08:01actually.

00:08:03I'll probably break this down a little bit more maybe in,

00:08:06well, we'll see. Maybe not. But rather than getting a reward whenever a block is mined, that's

00:08:13the oldest way of doing this.

00:08:16And,

00:08:17brains is one of the few mining pools left that still does that. They're going to move to this system

00:08:22where essentially they calculate, oh, this is what your reward in average would be in

00:08:29every day, every block, I guess. I'm not exactly sure,

00:08:34but you get that fixed amount. It will make it. I it must be every block. Otherwise, when you lose a miner,

00:08:40you can't it

00:08:41that that's what makes sense. It would be every block. Yeah.

00:08:45You get a fixed amount per your hash rate. So If I have a set number of miners that are all online and all hashing,

00:08:53I would know

00:08:55how much am I going to get today, tomorrow. It makes it more predictable.

00:09:00So a lot of people like it. I don't know. Yeah. I tell you, it is a little annoying when you go for a day or 2.

00:09:07As, again, we had 2 days ago, we went without a block,

00:09:12you know, without getting a a a block.

00:09:16I know overall this is not really gonna change things, but, but it will make it easier for to do calculations

00:09:23if I'm looking

00:09:24to,

00:09:25project

00:09:26cost, this kind of thing. So I will look forward to it from that. There was a couple of other announcements. There was a new mining pool that was, being started up called Ocean. Got a lot of hype. You got Jack,

00:09:40Dorsey

00:09:41from,

00:09:42ex Twitter guy,

00:09:45behind it through some money. Apparently, they got, like, $6,000,000

00:09:49to start up this mining pool, which just boggles my mind.

00:09:53Supposedly,

00:09:54they're so they're gonna be using Stratum v 2,

00:09:58which braiins does as well. Braiins supports Stratum. Now, apparently, they're

00:10:04enabling features,

00:10:06that nobody else does. So Stratum is fairly new. Stratum  v2, I should say.

00:10:11And, you know, it's it's getting rolled out. So they're really

00:10:16trying to kind of do everything

00:10:19all at once.

00:10:20They've gotten some backlash. I'm gonna reserve any kind of judgment because they just made an announcement a couple of days ago.

00:10:27Luke Dash junior is one of the people behind it who is a very old

00:10:31Bitcoin person. I he got in in the early days. I don't know exactly when. I don't mean age. He's younger than I am, I'm sure

00:10:39quite sure, but

00:10:42he's been around for a long time. So, anyways,

00:10:45he is involved,

00:10:46you know, some fairly prominent people.

00:10:50And, again,

00:10:51they've already had,

00:10:53some kind of

00:10:54pushback.

00:10:56I'm not even gonna get into today because at this point, it's kind of, gossip and whatever.

00:11:01Water cooler talk. I I don't typically engage in that.

00:11:06I I do wanna give, especially somebody new like this, kind of the benefit of the doubt. We'll see.

00:11:12But that was a new deal coming out, so,

00:11:15a little more money news there.

00:11:17Let's take a look at the market, though.

00:11:20We're holding steady. Our price right now, 37,739.

00:11:25We have not actually fluctuated

00:11:28very much

00:11:29on Tuesday.

00:11:31And then again on Wednesday,

00:11:33we went up and we touched, you know, 38,000,

00:11:36went a little bit above it both days.

00:11:40Today, we have, actually, I guess we did. That must have been late last night.

00:11:45We went right above 38,000,

00:11:48but we've we've

00:11:50definitely being helmed in by this next line of resistance.

00:11:55And it looks to me like it's going to do exactly what I was projecting

00:11:59where it's gonna kinda crawl sideways, and then it will be forced either to go

00:12:05go up and break out of this upward channel or it will go down and and fall out of it, so to speak. And then If that's the case, it could go down a bit.

00:12:15I should not do this. I was thinking about this earlier today, but I'm going to. Since I'm going to be off

00:12:21for the entire month of December,

00:12:23I'm going to go ahead and project out, and I shouldn't do this. Of course, this is not absolutely trading advice. What we always talk about here,

00:12:31Generation Bitcoin

00:12:32is,

00:12:33you know, DCA. Dollar cost average, you should be buying using something like strike or, you know, ideally,

00:12:40in some non KYC manner. I I get how difficult that is. We're gonna be talking about that kind of stuff more,

00:12:47with Satoshi's plebs. Of course, I've already

00:12:50discussed that a bit.

00:12:52Privacy is becoming a huge thing, and we need to be very aware of what's going on. So, anyways,

00:12:59however you do that, you should be doing that. Don't be trading. Don't it's gambling. I mean, it's,

00:13:06Well, maybe it's more than gambling, but, yeah, it's for most people, it's gambling. And and really, that's the way a lot of them they, oh, this token's gonna go to the moon. They throw money at it, and then maybe it does very briefly, but then they don't take their money out and it bust and they lose all their money. That happens a lot.

00:13:26Or people are telling, hey. Bitcoin's going to $100,000.

00:13:29I've people have already been saying by the end of the year, is going to $100,000.

00:13:33Now that was a month ago since we're only at $37,747.

00:13:40Maybe they've withdrawn that. I don't know. Or 200 k by conference day or or whatever, and then you, you know, you kinda ape in. You throw your money in and you lose it.

00:13:51So,

00:13:52anyways, I do this because I find these patterns interesting.

00:13:57I do think in general terms, they certainly give a pretty good idea.

00:14:01I would say just looking at this upward channel, which we've now been in

00:14:07for a month.

00:14:09Yes, over a

00:14:10month. Actually, we early

00:14:13October 24th, not early October, but October 24th is when we entered this upward channel,

00:14:19and it has played out perfectly.

00:14:22I do believe we are going to be at 40 k before the end of the year. Now, again, not trading advice.

00:14:28Don't

00:14:30do not cut this out if we do not reach 40 k and say, well, he said so.

00:14:35I'm just

00:14:38I'm just sitting here at the water cooler, man. That's all I'm doing. Okay?

00:14:42But given the upward channel,

00:14:45given the predictability

00:14:47that most likely it's going to go up, given that we're already above of and established a fairly strong

00:14:55support level at 375.

00:14:58If we can make it above this 38 2 or so level, which we're now testing,

00:15:04you know, I think we will we will head on up to 40 at that point. I think we'll touch 40 before the end of the year, if not go higher.

00:15:12I got my next line of resistance at

00:15:1540000201.

00:15:17It may not make it above that,

00:15:20but we'll see. If we have a strong breakout of this,

00:15:24ascending channel, we could. And then, you know, we'd Be off to the races for a couple of 1,000 anyways

00:15:31up to about 42,000.

00:15:33So I'm pretty positive about the rest of this year. In I'll be honest. I'm pretty positive all the way up till,

00:15:40and then on into the later part of the year. I'm sure there will be dips.

00:15:45Absolutely,

00:15:46we may pull back to 35,000.

00:15:49I'll just be honest. We could I could see it. I could see us falling out of this ascending

00:15:55channel,

00:15:57going down,

00:15:58hitting 35,000

00:15:59or something like that, and then shooting right back up.

00:16:03There is so much positivity

00:16:05in this market now in terms money's not moving. And by money, I mean, Bitcoin.

00:16:11People are not

00:16:13moving their Bitcoin up to exchanges to sell.

00:16:18Over 70% have held for,

00:16:21what was it? I said it a couple weeks ago.

00:16:23Like, 2 years or so.

00:16:25Alright. So there's my prediction. There's my end of year prediction. We'll see. 40 k by the end of the year. Will I get back on before the end of the year? No. Not even if there's a Bitcoin ETF, and there could be 1 approved by them. I'm not going to do it. I will restrain myself.

00:16:42I've already prepped everybody on all of this stuff. You know?

00:16:46If BlackRock gets approved. Yes. The price is gonna shoot up. In fact, it would smash 40 k. There's no doubt about that. It would I don't know where it would stop. It might go up to 60. I could definitely see that. It might go higher

00:17:00even within a just a couple of months. I don't know. We will see.

00:17:05We could have some very bad news.

00:17:08So we'll jump into today's topic at this point.

00:17:12There were some more

00:17:15attempts,

00:17:16the beginnings of attempts

00:17:20at regulation,

00:17:22here in the United States.

00:17:24And I wanted to point this out way back

00:17:28January,

00:17:29December last year now,

00:17:32I was talking about how 2023

00:17:34is going to be the year of regulation,

00:17:38and, it has proven to be

00:17:41certainly.

00:17:43I have a feeling

00:17:45that that regulation will continue.

00:17:48I believe we have multiple years of this left

00:17:52before

00:17:53the governmental bodies of the world,

00:17:56really,

00:17:57not just United States or whomever,

00:18:00forms frameworks that Bitcoin can operate in.

00:18:06And until that's done, until we get reasonableness

00:18:10in

00:18:11the way that Bitcoin is treated,

00:18:14we need to continue to be very aware of these, and we need to continue to push back when necessary. And I believe that this is

00:18:21another case where a pushback needs to happen. So without further ado,

00:18:26the treasury,

00:18:28on

00:18:3011/28,

00:18:31so just 2 days ago,

00:18:33has gone to congress, writing congress, and, saying,

00:18:38We want new power

00:18:40over crypto.

00:18:42In general, they're not talking about Bitcoin specifically,

00:18:46but this will, I assure you,

00:18:49fall

00:18:50under,

00:18:52Bitcoin will fall under this act. So their argument is they're trying to crack down on illicit activity in crypto. Now this is an age old argument.

00:19:01It gets refuted over and over again.

00:19:04Criminals use,

00:19:05by and large

00:19:07cash.

00:19:08So I guess if we really wanna get rid of criminals,

00:19:12money laundering of all the things that go along with that, then, you know, we should get rid of cash. So here's what they're saying. Treasury is asking congress to grant new power to go after crypto and fintech platforms,

00:19:25used by militant organizations

00:19:27like Hamas according to documents attained by Politico.

00:19:32Of political as a website here in the United States.

00:19:34Obviously, very politically oriented as terrorists,

00:19:37transnational

00:19:38criminals,

00:19:39and rogue states

00:19:43turns to sorry. That was sound effects by Macintosh.

00:19:46Turns to digital assets to finance their activities.

00:19:50We need to build an enforcement

00:19:53regime

00:19:54that is capable

00:19:56of preventing

00:19:57This activity,

00:19:59deputy treasurer

00:20:00secretary Wally

00:20:02Adeamo

00:20:03wrote in a letter to senate banking chair, Sherrod Brown, Democrat, Ohio, House Financial Services chair, Patrick McHenry,

00:20:11Republican from North Carolina, and ranking members, senator Tom Tim Scott,

00:20:17Republican from South Carolina, and

00:20:19representative Maxine Waters,

00:20:22Democrat from California.

00:20:25So there's,

00:20:27a lot more than just this letter.

00:20:30There was a lot

00:20:32here.

00:20:34And

00:20:34they make it very broad. They do that on purpose.

00:20:39It's a power grab.

00:20:41Why the treasury would have, of the United States, the people who manage the money,

00:20:47would have any input

00:20:49into

00:20:51Fintech platforms

00:20:52and crypto at this point. I don't understand.

00:20:56I don't.

00:20:57Now maybe I'm being

00:20:59naive,

00:21:00but they're looking,

00:21:02to categorize,

00:21:04financial institutions that are involved in crypto under the Bank secrecy act? Oh, okay. You can't

00:21:11send

00:21:12$10,000

00:21:13from me to you,

00:21:15from

00:21:16swan Bitcoin

00:21:18to unchained

00:21:19because that's gonna fall under the BSA.

00:21:22That's just one example.

00:21:24The authority to sanction notes and chains. I don't know what they mean by notes.

00:21:29Now how they're gonna sanction Bitcoin, I don't know how that's gonna work out

00:21:33because, Bitcoin isn't a security. Bitcoin doesn't have a foundation.

00:21:37Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO, CTO,

00:21:40CFO, or any of those other c letters.

00:21:44Bitcoin

00:21:45doesn't employ anyone, so go ahead and sanction

00:21:49Bitcoin and watch us care.

00:21:52Tools to sever crypto operations

00:21:55from the US.

00:21:57I actually think that's what we see in a case like Binance going on right down where,

00:22:03you know, clearly, they think that there was a lot of malfeasance

00:22:08going on,

00:22:10with Binance. So they basically kicked them out of the country, gave them a huge fine on the way out the door. And

00:22:17I guess, from what I'm understanding, literally putting the CEO of Binance in jail for, like, 6 months. Federal penitentiary,

00:22:25I'm sure. So he'll probably have a nice cushy little place there to do some quiet contemplation

00:22:31along with his, what, $150,000,000

00:22:34fine,

00:22:35which is chump change for him, frankly,

00:22:38not to be dis well, I guess that is being dismissive, but still,

00:22:43I don't know. I mean, I I don't know.

00:22:47I think they were trying to make an example of them, and This would give the treasury department the tools to sever those,

00:22:55operations. So,

00:22:57In this case, of course, it went through our justice department,

00:23:02as it probably should have.

00:23:04I do not know if all the

00:23:06information will come out about what they found.

00:23:10I do know that there were some leaks of,

00:23:14you know, like, Slack channel messaging

00:23:17or whatever it was that they used, and it was

00:23:21not good stuff. They were definitely trying to circumvent

00:23:25the United States laws

00:23:27when they would have someone who was trying to work with them from the United States, so

00:23:33I don't know.

00:23:34Oh, and most importantly, maybe

00:23:37direct authority overall USD

00:23:39Stablecoins.

00:23:40So

00:23:41I cannot go out as Joe Bitcoin,

00:23:45for example,

00:23:46and make a Stablecoin based on lightning,

00:23:49with the what is it called? Taproot assets, I think.

00:23:53We can now mint

00:23:55essentially stable assets

00:23:57on that. That's something that I

00:24:00I have an interest in personally.

00:24:03I'll probably talk about that in the future, but

00:24:06but no. That would directly fall under the treasury.

00:24:09Why?

00:24:10Because the treasury is in charge of the United States dollar.

00:24:13That one,

00:24:14at least from their perspective, certainly makes sense.

00:24:18I wanted to make everyone aware of this. This is not something that we need to dismiss.

00:24:24I hope it dies in congress and never

00:24:28gains any kind of traction,

00:24:31but it's definitely

00:24:33something that you need to be aware of. I will be including

00:24:36a link in the show notes to the Politico,

00:24:40article.

00:24:43Yeah. Unfortunately,

00:24:44it's behind a paywall, but I will include a link to the article. I will also try and find some other information about it to include as well. So that's it.

00:24:54One final thing to go off into this year. I hope that, maybe all the politicians could go home for the holidays,

00:25:01like starting tomorrow would be great

00:25:04and stay out of our business. But that's just me. McIntosh here, his opinion. Alright.

00:25:10Let's,

00:25:11let's move on.

00:25:15It looks like

00:25:17within the hour, according to Oscar at Fountain,

00:25:20the new one point o beta build will be out.

00:25:25So I will certainly

00:25:27be testing things.

00:25:28Alright. Just came out hot off the press,

00:25:33but that's not what I'm looking for. Here we go.

00:25:36I'm gonna go ahead and do this right off of here. I'm not gonna pull up the spreadsheet.

00:25:41There we go. Yep.

00:25:44So when did that come in? November 27. I think this came in post

00:25:50the last episode.

00:25:51Today is Thursday. Yes. It did.

00:25:54I got a great

00:25:57boost.

00:25:58Yes. There's where I exported. I got a great boost on the 27th,

00:26:02so let me bring up the calendar. That was Monday.

00:26:0510,000 sats

00:26:07sent using Podverse.

00:26:10Awesome.

00:26:10From anonymous.

00:26:12Too many sats in my Albie Wallet after transferring

00:26:16WOS, which is Wallet of Satoshi,

00:26:19balance over. Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you very much.

00:26:22I do appreciate that anonymous

00:26:25very, very much. And

00:26:27I actually meant to mention this last week. I did not.

00:26:31Wallet of Satoshi, which is a custodial

00:26:34Bitcoin wallet,

00:26:35has pulled out of the US market. They've been removed

00:26:40from the Amazon,

00:26:43Apple and

00:26:45Google Play Store,

00:26:47App Stores,

00:26:48and they say it's because of the regulation. They say they're just not even gonna deal with it essentially. Now I don't know if they were pressured to do that. There's no telling.

00:26:58That's their story.

00:27:00If you have a wallet of Hitoshi here in the United States,

00:27:04you still have it. It's still there.

00:27:07But my suggestion would be you should probably take a hint and move your

00:27:12move your Bitcoin. So, again, I appreciate that.

00:27:16We got a boost from mere mortals.

00:27:18RODUX,

00:27:1920222.

00:27:21Enjoy your break, Macintosh.

00:27:23Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Thanks.

00:27:26I appreciate that,

00:27:28in advance.

00:27:29Of course, I will not be on. But, Yes. Kyron, I do appreciate that.

00:27:34Merry Christmas. Happy New Years to you down there in Australia,

00:27:39as well.

00:27:40And in fact, I will go ahead and say this in case I forget it at the end because I don't have my notes.

00:27:46The same goes for all the listeners, of course.

00:27:49I hope that you have a happy,

00:27:52rest of the year.

00:27:54And finally,

00:27:56we got a boost actually earlier today,

00:28:00500 sat boost,

00:28:02anonymous.

00:28:03It doesn't say from whom.

00:28:05It doesn't say any details.

00:28:08Yeah. But that did come in today

00:28:12just a couple hours ago. So I do appreciate that.

00:28:15So very awesome.

00:28:17I appreciate that.

00:28:19Let's go ahead and jump on into the news.

00:28:22A few things.

00:28:24Peter Schiff, who's a well known

00:28:26you know,

00:28:28he's a gold bug, actually, he's very anti Bitcoin, which is very unfortunate.

00:28:34He just does not get it,

00:28:37which is fine,

00:28:39to each their own, but, he's, I would say, an Austrian.

00:28:44Anyways,

00:28:45he says that the US economy is already in recession. Through q three,

00:28:50GDP grew by 5.2%.

00:28:53So during the Q3,

00:28:56our GDP

00:28:57grew by 5.2%,

00:28:59but then government spending contributed five point 5%.

00:29:05So without government spending, which in my mind is not part of the economy, it's just

00:29:11frankly, waste,

00:29:13essentially.

00:29:15So without that spending, GDP would have contracted by 0.3 percent. Government spending borrowed money doesn't reflect

00:29:22real economic growth. It only leads to

00:29:25higher

00:29:26inflation. So because this is Twitter, there was some context added here, and this actually does make sense.

00:29:33So maybe a little bit of pushback against Peter. They said this is not correct. Government spending increased by 5.5%.

00:29:41It did not contribute. I think he meant 5.2%.

00:29:45I doubt Peter got that wrong, but either way, it's

00:29:49a a high number.

00:29:51It did not contribute 5.5%

00:29:54to GDP growth. That is correct.

00:29:57The spending grew,

00:29:59which is not good. It should be going down, not up. But that would not have in the exact same ratio

00:30:07increased

00:30:08the overall GDP,

00:30:10by the way that they calculate it.

00:30:12There was a

00:30:14tweet that I posted

00:30:16about

00:30:17the upcoming.

00:30:18I believe

00:30:20even

00:30:21unless price really rockets gets off.

00:30:24The miners are going to be hurt

00:30:26when the happening occurs because the the reward gets cut in half.

00:30:31The price does not double instantaneously

00:30:33from 1 block to the next. It does not. We see that, you know, over the months afterwards.

00:30:40But

00:30:41I just don't think that some of these miners are prepared for that.

00:30:45I do think we're gonna see some hurt. I think we could see some consolidation,

00:30:50maybe some capitulation.

00:30:52I hope I'm wrong.

00:30:54I just don't think so.

00:30:56Real quick, Germany. Germany's residential grid operators will be empowered to restrict the flow of power to heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers from 2024

00:31:07in order to preserve the stability

00:31:11of the grid.

00:31:12Right.

00:31:13Why is their grid unstable?

00:31:15Because they're not building and turning on nuclear power plants and they're not building

00:31:19natural gas facilities that they need and this kind of thing. Because,

00:31:24you know

00:31:25well,

00:31:26I I don't know.

00:31:28Actually, I don't know. I don't understand it, but that's what it is.

00:31:32I've been reporting on,

00:31:35Germany who, by the way, is now officially in recession for over a year,

00:31:39and I I've it's sad. It's a beautiful country. It's a great country, and it's the economic powerhouse of the EU,

00:31:47and they're shooting themselves in the foot.

00:31:50And that's it for for the news. So I'm going to go through my ending spiel here without my notes, this may be fun,

00:31:58but Generation Bitcoin,

00:32:00soon to be the Potashiplebs

00:32:02podcast,

00:32:04is a value for value

00:32:06show.

00:32:08You know, I completely depend on supporters like anonymous,

00:32:12like Kyron at Mere Mortals

00:32:14to, you know, to support the show in a in a

00:32:17direct way with treasure with you know, in value for value lingo, so to speak, there's 3 things. There's time, there's talent, there's treasure.

00:32:26Treasure sat streaming from a podcasting two point o app,

00:32:30which you can go to new podcast apps dot come and check that out. Try out the new fountain 1 point o when it comes out. Try,

00:32:39you know, podcast guru or whatever. There's a whole list of them there, and they will allow you to directly interact with these podcast 2 point o

00:32:47podcast like mine.

00:32:50You'll see chapter art, you'll see,

00:32:54boost,

00:32:55all of this kind of stuff that's getting turned on,

00:33:00transcripts,

00:33:01those kind of things. So,

00:33:04I'm gonna be off for the next month.

00:33:06Essentially,

00:33:07I will be busy building things to make this better when I come back as Toshi's plebs. So I really appreciate everybody's support this year. Please continue to spread the news. I will do what I

00:33:19can in January

00:33:20to promote things,

00:33:22because the name will change. You will not have to update your streams or whatever.

00:33:26That should be automatic.

00:33:28But,

00:33:29looking forward to it. You all have a great rest of your year.

00:33:34Have a Merry Christmas,

00:33:35happy holidays,

00:33:37happy New Year, all of that kind of stuff. I really, really appreciate it. I will talk to y'all soon.
