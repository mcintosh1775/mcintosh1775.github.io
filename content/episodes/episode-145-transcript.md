McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, Sat Stackers. Today is November 19th, and this is episode 145 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, McIntosh. And today's episode

00:00:08is did Argentina

00:00:10win?

00:00:41Alright. We're gonna do the market update, and we are going to

00:00:46talk about

00:00:47Argentina

00:00:48today.

00:00:49A few other things as well. We're gonna talk about our supporters,

00:00:54little bit of news,

00:00:57and

00:00:58call it a day.

00:01:00It's been a week since I last talked to you.

00:01:03Dear listeners, and thank you for being patient. I did not record on Thursday.

00:01:08Just life, you know, just too busy,

00:01:11to be honest.

00:01:13And, shame on me. I guess that shouldn't be the case, but,

00:01:17but it was. It was more or less work

00:01:20related all day long,

00:01:23from morning until late at night and

00:01:26and Wednesday night as well. I do normally on Wednesdays record and then put it out on Thursdays, but,

00:01:34sometimes I record on Thursdays and put it out on Thursdays. Did not make either one. So, again, I apologize.

00:01:40Market update.

00:01:41Well,

00:01:42If I go back to what I talked about a week ago,

00:01:46what did I say?

00:01:49I said,

00:01:51something to the effect of

00:01:54I really thought it looked like it was going to go lower, but it really wants to go higher, if that makes sense. Just kind of the way that

00:02:04I don't know. At some point, maybe you kinda get a feel for this. I don't know.

00:02:09But with as much activity as we had had,

00:02:13even as bullish as the charts had been,

00:02:18it was time for a pullback, and we got that.

00:02:21So if we go back 7 days let me adjust my chart real quick.

00:02:27I do know the weekly closed last week,

00:02:30which I

00:02:31we reported on last episode was 37,000

00:02:34and seventy. So

00:02:36we have our market now

00:02:39of what? 37347.

00:02:41So, basically, it was, like, $300 higher right now, but that doesn't tell the whole story.

00:02:471, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Right.

00:02:51So we dropped

00:02:54yeah. So Sunday wasn't too bad, but we were basically at our high when we open not too far below it. We went, like, a pop couple 100 up, and then we fell. And then Monday, we dropped. Tuesday, we dropped all the way down to 34

00:03:10is in 600 nope. 34,700.

00:03:14I'll get it right in a minute. 34, yeah, 34782,

00:03:18somewhere around 34,800

Unknown:00:03:21800.

00:03:22And then the next day,

00:03:24so we're talking about Wednesday,

00:03:27we went

00:03:28all the way up

00:03:30to 37985.

00:03:31We touched 38,000,

McIntosh:00:03:33and then we went right back down. It was it's been a roller coaster of a week, really,

00:03:38but

00:03:40we've come right back up over the last 1, 2, 3 days. Now we're opening the 4th day.

00:03:45So we're right back where we started.

00:03:48And I was pulling back a little bit, of course,

00:03:52looking

00:03:53at the overall patterns

00:03:55And what I'm seeing come apart come about right now

00:03:59is

00:04:00a ascending channel.

00:04:02So you've got basically 2 lines that are parallel to each other that

00:04:07are going ascending. You're getting higher highs and

00:04:11lower lower highs. Yes. That makes sense. Higher highs and lower highs as well. So

00:04:17and it's in this

00:04:20kind of upward angle.

00:04:22This is a bullish pattern.

00:04:25Normally, we would break

00:04:27upwards out of this.

00:04:29And what we are doing and what we have been doing, in fact,

00:04:33for the last

00:04:35roughly

00:04:3721 days,

00:04:38not 21, almost a full month. October 24th is kind of when this pattern started.

Unknown:00:04:45So 3 day 4 day 4 or 5 days from being

00:04:50a full month,

McIntosh:00:04:51we've been in this bullish pattern. The expectation

00:04:54would be ultimately,

00:04:56we broke

00:04:57high. Now what we saw last week and what I was describing,

00:05:01we've we've had so much bullish upward.

00:05:04Yes, we did fall for 1, 2, 3, 4 days in a row, then we had a nice green day, and then we fell again.

00:05:11So we did we've kind of released some of that pressure, if you wanna call it that.

00:05:16Now that's all fuzzy and whatever. You can call it whatever you want,

00:05:20But the reality is we are staying in these upward channels.

00:05:24The

00:05:25lines of these upward channels. We've actually gone a little higher in a couple of, it's not perfectly clean if I were to take a screenshot of this and post it. It's not textbook,

00:05:36but

00:05:37it is actually

00:05:39breaking on the high side, not the low side,

00:05:42if that makes sense.

00:05:43So it is a very bullish indicator to me. So I do think we're gonna end up going higher.

00:05:50I could see us heading on up to, ultimately to $40,000,

00:05:54and then we'll see what happens there.

00:05:57So we may be testing that level

00:05:59here shortly.

00:06:01If you look at the weekly patterns, we've had 1,

Unknown:00:06:052, 3, 4 weeks in a row now.

00:06:08Solid green.

00:06:10So that actually goes back, yeah, to that,

McIntosh:00:06:15October 23rd. If you wanna go back no. Actually, we've had 5 weeks I apologize.

Unknown:00:06:20Going all the way back to October 16th,

00:06:23we're opening our 6th week.

00:06:26It will remain to be seen. Will it be green or red?

00:06:30I

00:06:32believe we will have a small pause here.

00:06:36I

McIntosh:00:06:37so

00:06:38to be clear, I know this can be confusing.

Unknown:00:06:41We're near the top of the ascending

00:06:44channel.

McIntosh:00:06:46The top right now would be right about 38,000.

00:06:48So we're like 700. I think it will probably go up touch that, and then it will come back

Unknown:00:06:54down to roughly 36,000

McIntosh:00:06:58because we've had 5 weeks in a row

00:07:01of upward movement. It's going to at some point.

00:07:06We're we're not just going to march eternally upward, but I do think we will

00:07:10kind of pull back and consolidate on the lower part of this.

00:07:15The good news is, listener, you don't have to worry about anything that I just said,

00:07:20it may or may not come true.

00:07:23As we always say here on generation Bitcoin, I know y'all

00:07:26you boost it if you if you like this part of the show or if you don't like it. I don't you know? I'm seeking listener feedback, not criticism or whatever. Just just say.

00:07:39If you really don't care for this part, if you don't find this interesting, then let me know. If you do,

00:07:46I will try and make it more concise, but we'll we'll continue to do it more.

00:07:51I enjoy at least looking at these and trying to figure it out and understand.

00:07:55Maybe give me an idea of where things might go. But, of course, we always talk here about DCA. You should be

00:08:02adding to your stack daily, if at all possible,

00:08:06of Bitcoin. Don't worry about the price. Don't worry about if we break 40,000 or 38,000

00:08:12or 39,000

00:08:13or if we drop to 35,000 or

00:08:16or whatever. You know? This week, we dropped down to 36,000

00:08:21excuse excuse me, 34,800,

00:08:23like I said, would have been a great opportunity to buy,

00:08:27of course, but do you know that that's gonna be no. You don't know. Don't worry about it. Just buy. If you think it's pretty low,

00:08:35buy double if you can.

00:08:37Just keep doing it. That's

00:08:39that's it. The long term DCA are the ones

00:08:43statistically who win

00:08:46in this game, if you wanna call it a game.

00:08:49So there you go. In addition,

00:08:51of course,

00:08:53let's take a look at our time,

00:08:56our calendar,

00:08:59our blockchain statistics. We are at

00:09:03817,565

00:09:03as we record,

00:09:07which ironically is 10 blocks more than 1000

00:09:12from the last time. So in other words, we were 816-555

00:09:16last time if I'm not mistaken.

00:09:19Our transaction fees are still very high. Gonna return to that in just a second.

00:09:24Our difficulty adjustment

00:09:26or our our last adjustment was 3.55%.

00:09:30That was on November 12th.

00:09:33And our next adjustment right now is looking like it's gonna be around 2%. As I record this, it's 2.41

00:09:42%,

Unknown:00:09:44but we will see. But, again, looking at an upward adjustment.

00:09:49Now let's talk about

McIntosh:00:09:51fees. Fees are about to drive me crazy. They're still

00:09:54very high. Our mempool

00:09:56is filled overflowing. It's actually at one point

00:09:593 5 gigabytes

00:10:00as I speak,

00:10:02and the fees themselves have been very high. Now as a miner,

00:10:07of course,

00:10:08this is a very good thing.

00:10:11It's been profitable when we've been mining blocks this week.

00:10:15Had a couple of slow days here, but prior to that, we've done okay.

00:10:19But right now, a low priority transaction is a 129 sats per v byte. That's

00:10:256 point,

00:10:27$746.74,

00:10:30a 168

00:10:32sats per v byte for a medium priority and then 2.22

00:10:37for a high priority, and that's $11.61.

00:10:41So we're quite high, and we've been high.

00:10:44And it very rarely fluctuates downward. I've got some things, frankly, I need to do on chain, and I'm starting to begin to wonder

00:10:53if I'm going to have to

00:10:55just do it and pay the fees. I keep hoping that these stupid ordinals would run out

00:11:02and fee activity

00:11:04would drop lower. There's

00:11:07high fees

00:11:08going on right now, and these may continue for a long time.

00:11:12One of the things we probably need to talk about before we wrap up for the year

00:11:17on November 30th

00:11:19will be

Unknown:00:11:20kind of ways that we could avoid this, and, unfortunately, it's not

00:11:25easy or,

McIntosh:00:11:26you know, ideal or whatever, but maybe there are some things that you can do to save some money

00:11:33if you're dealing with on chain.

00:11:35So maybe we should talk about that.

00:11:38But just to give you an idea of that's what's going on. So what's our topic?

00:11:42Did Argentina win?

00:11:44Macintosh, what are you talking about? Well, many of you probably know. I've talked about it a number of times off and on.

00:11:51The Argentina

00:11:52primary

00:11:53election was today, and they do have a winner, and I will announce that in just a second.

00:11:59And that's what we're gonna talk about.

00:12:01But we've had people on from Argentina.

00:12:03We've talked about the Argentina election, then we've kinda did a live thing

00:12:09during the last round,

00:12:11I gave the results as I recorded, and then I think I pushed out right after that.

00:12:16And tonight, I'm actually going to push this out as well as as soon as I get it done and edited.

00:12:22But, I did wanna let you know,

00:12:26it was official that Javier Milei did win the election earlier today,

00:12:32the

00:12:33person who was running against him did concede,

00:12:38And, Javier will be taking office. I do not know when that takes place.

00:12:43As I have stated, and I continue to stand by this. Argentina

00:12:47needs

00:12:48change.

00:12:50I do not know

00:12:52Javier is the answer,

00:12:55but at least they're trying something different.

00:12:58We'll talk about that for a few minutes,

00:13:01Then we'll talk about our supporters,

00:13:03talk about the news,

00:13:04what news there was outside of this,

00:13:07and then we'll wrap things up.

00:13:11So Argentina.

00:13:12So one of the,

00:13:14resources that I will be linking to in the show notes is an article

00:13:19from CNN,

00:13:20just to give you an idea. Now

Unknown:00:13:23Javier,

00:13:24is

00:13:25so called

McIntosh:00:13:26right wing, if you wanna call it that.

00:13:29He is he considers himself a libertarian. He probably is a libertarian by virtually anyone's definition.

00:13:36By the way, this is showing that he won

00:13:39more than 94% of the votes have been counted,

Unknown:00:13:42over 55% of the votes. 13

00:13:450.781,000,000

00:13:47votes.

McIntosh:00:13:49So he had a clear victory. It was actually closer than I thought it would be. I honestly thought most of I thought it'd be 60, 65%. And the reason why I say that,

00:14:02the person who dropped out of the last round who was forced and I apologize.

00:14:06I do not remember. It was Barbara something, if I'm not mistaken, but I don't remember her last name.

00:14:12Anyways,

00:14:13she was more

00:14:15right leaning

00:14:17then

00:14:18the

00:14:19minister,

00:14:21Sergio Masa, that he defeated.

00:14:24I figured that those voters would essentially

00:14:27move over to Javier, and certainly some of them did. A lot of them did.

00:14:32But I thought it would be even more of a convincing victory if you wanna call it that.

00:14:38This is not the article I was looking at. Let me pull that up real quick. I wanted to point out a couple of things in this article.

Unknown:00:14:45I thought it was

00:14:47pretty crazy.

McIntosh:00:14:48I don't know if you are right leaning or left leaning,

00:14:53I try and stay out of this stuff

00:14:56or middle of the road so called or or whatever.

00:14:59They have flat updated this.

00:15:02The link to the article

00:15:05Alright. Well, I'll try and summarize what I saw. Unfortunately, this means that I,

00:15:10well, I'll tell you what I saw. Journalism,

00:15:15in my opinion,

00:15:17mainstream journalism

00:15:19is virtually dead.

00:15:21There's

00:15:22mostly regurgitation

00:15:24of other news sources, this kind of thing, you'll see a lot of Reuters news articles,

00:15:29this kind of thing being

Unknown:00:15:32just redistributed

00:15:33by

00:15:34Fox, CNN, whoever it is.

00:15:37And, unfortunately,

McIntosh:00:15:39with the majority of these news sources, they will either lean right or they will lean left and typically,

00:15:46very much one way or the other.

Unknown:00:15:49They do not take the time to dissect anything,

McIntosh:00:15:53or even have an understanding really, especially if it doesn't meet their worldview.

00:15:59So CNN certainly

00:16:01would be a left leaning organization. They're probably a little less than they used to be, to be honest, but they're still very left leaning.

00:16:08And they have been very careful

00:16:11in every

00:16:13article that they posted about Javier

00:16:15he is a far right outsider.

00:16:19So, you know, they wanna make him sound like he's this radical,

00:16:23you know, far right.

00:16:25I don't know what that makes you Hitler,

00:16:27I guess.

00:16:29What's the word? It's not communist. It's left,

00:16:33right would fascist.

00:16:35Fascist, I think, is the proper terminology political terminology.

Unknown:00:16:40Now

00:16:41I do not live in Argentina.

McIntosh:00:16:43I am gonna give my opinion on this,

00:16:46as an outsider, as someone who does not speak Spanish.

00:16:49And so there are things that sometimes I just don't understand,

Unknown:00:16:54but

00:16:56he's not a far right

00:16:58Canada. He is a libertarian,

00:17:01and that brings a worldview if you wanna call it that.

McIntosh:00:17:06But he's not a fascist. He's not let me look this up because I'm almost I I don't wanna be misspeaking.

00:17:18Yes. That is the correct.

00:17:21And I think they do that. So the definition,

00:17:24literally, I'm I'm just gonna from Wikipedia.

00:17:28Fascism is a far right authoritarian

00:17:30ultranationalist

00:17:31political ideology and movement characterized by a

00:17:35dictatorial leader,

00:17:36centralized autocracy,

00:17:39militarism,

00:17:40forcible suppression of opposition,

00:17:42belief in natural social

00:17:44hierarchy,

00:17:46subordination

00:17:47of individual interest for the for the perceived. I'm not even gonna keep reading.

00:17:51I'd have to click through and whatever, but it I think you get the idea.

00:17:57I think they do this on purpose.

00:18:00He's not a fascist.

00:18:02He is a libertarian from everything that I understand, And I may not agree with everything that he says and probably won't.

00:18:10In fact, undoubtedly, I won't,

00:18:14but I don't think that's very fair.

00:18:18And they also completely misrepresented

00:18:22the

00:18:23inflation data. See, now this is what they've updated. Now maybe they just made a mistake, but they seem to make lots of mistakes like this.

Unknown:00:18:31They said something along

McIntosh:00:18:33the effects of,

00:18:36inflation was a 144%

00:18:41or something along those lines. But it's now down

00:18:44from that high

Unknown:00:18:47by, like, 30 points.

00:18:50And that's

00:18:51absolutely

00:18:52categorically

McIntosh:00:18:52not true and took me, like, three minutes to verify.

Unknown:00:18:57So I have a link in the show notes to tradingeconomics.com,

McIntosh:00:19:04which I find to be a reputable website

00:19:09on the inflation data for Argentina, And it very clearly shows what I absolutely

00:19:14remember

00:19:16that in September,

00:19:18the inflation was a 138.3%,

00:19:21technically.

00:19:23And in October,

00:19:24it was 142

00:19:260.7%.

00:19:27If I showed you this chart

00:19:30going all the way back to December

00:19:33November 1 year ago well, that makes sense.

00:19:37It started at 92%

00:19:39in November.

00:19:4092.4.

00:19:41It's now at 142.7.

00:19:44It is literally straight up except July

00:19:47when it dipped from 115.6

00:19:50to 113.4,

00:19:52and then the next month in August went up to 124

00:19:56point four.

00:19:57So that fabrication

00:19:59was a complete lie.

Unknown:00:20:01It was a complete

00:20:02non truth. I'm not gonna say they were lying

00:20:06certainly on purpose.

00:20:08If if you're lying, you

00:20:10well, you're doing that to mislead people. They may have just been stupid.

00:20:15Excuse

00:20:16me. But,

McIntosh:00:20:18you know, it's a really simple thing to verify,

00:20:22And it's a very important point of

00:20:24Javier's

00:20:25candidacy.

00:20:26This was

00:20:28the center of his candidacy. See, what is causing this? The Central Bank

00:20:33of Argentina

00:20:35printing money out of control,

00:20:37taking loans with the IMF, the

00:20:41economic policies of Argentina.

Unknown:00:20:43Now, again, this, I'm an outsider. Again, I do not speak Spanish. Again, I know that

00:20:50colors my view, But this was his

McIntosh:00:20:53from everything that I can tell, this was like his core thing,

00:20:57and he is going to go in there. I put this on Twitter. I post he's going to go in there, and he's going to strip out a large number of governmental institutions.

00:21:06And you are going to hear

00:21:08caterwauling like you've never heard before

00:21:12if you're paying attention

00:21:13of people, of governmental officials,

00:21:17of busy bodies of

00:21:19probably a lot of media people in Argentina

00:21:21crying

00:21:22that he's shutting down this ministry and that ministry.

00:21:26And he's trying to save the country,

00:21:29in my opinion.

00:21:31So I wish him luck. I do. I truly do, and I mean that.

00:21:36I know that he has announced

00:21:38that he will be

00:21:41dollarizing

00:21:42the Peso. And I wanna make sure I get this correct. I I'm just gonna say I'm not sure because I've gone back and forth on this. I've been corrected,

00:21:51and I can't remember what the correction was.

00:21:54I believe

00:21:55that means that the peso

Unknown:00:21:59will be removed, and they will start using US dollars.

00:22:04It could mean

00:22:06that the peso will be pegged to the dollar.

McIntosh:00:22:11Either way,

00:22:12they're tying themselves

00:22:14to the United States

00:22:16in terms of economic policy, in terms of a stable currency

Unknown:00:22:22to try and control inflation. Now

McIntosh:00:22:24that may be a good short term view.

00:22:27We have inflation here in the United States.

00:22:30Our inflation may get worse over time. I believe it will.

00:22:34Long term, this is probably not the best thing to do. However, when you're at a 142.7%

00:22:41inflation,

00:22:42the house is on fire. You do what you have to do, and that would be a good move at least maybe for the next few years.

00:22:50I believe he has said he will abolish the central bank. I have no problem with that.

00:22:55Jefferson,

00:22:56one of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson,

00:22:59was very adamant that we should never have a government run bank.

00:23:04There's a quote about that, famous quote that floats around. I keep intending to actually do

00:23:09an episode on that, and maybe one day I will. So I won't go into that, but central banks are,

00:23:15in my mind, they're not a good thing. So,

00:23:18anyways, not to elaborate on that.

00:23:21He has said he will do that. He has

00:23:23he will go in and rip out a bunch of governmental agencies. I'm sure he will. Will there will everything be perfect? Absolutely not. Is he pro Bitcoin?

00:23:33Seems to be,

00:23:34we don't know where that's gonna go. Will he eventually move them to a Bitcoin standard? I would love it if he did,

00:23:40much like El Salvador, I do not know if that will happen. Has he gotten involved in other things certainly in the past?

00:23:48Absolutely,

00:23:49yes.

00:23:50So we know, historically, he's not been Bitcoin only.

00:23:54It remains to be seen what that actually means. I would love to believe and if I were to sit down with, mister Milley president Milley

00:24:04and say, mister Milley,

00:24:06president Malay, I apologize. I don't speak to such fancy people, so I don't I don't know all the niceties. I'm sorry.

00:24:13President Milei,

00:24:15you know, are are you a a Bitcoin Max here? Are you a Bitcoin only guy? Maybe that's a better way to say it.

00:24:21Well, yes. Okay. Great.

Unknown:00:24:24Here's what I don't see, the libertarian might say, well, we should just let all these compete,

00:24:30and that's probably his viewpoint or it was.

00:24:34We've seen that.

00:24:36Bitcoin is the only one that has any long term

00:24:39longevity.

McIntosh:00:24:41Heath, it's done okay.

00:24:44It's been around for a while. I don't think it's long for,

Unknown:00:24:47I think ten years from now, it'll be gone personally,

00:24:51for various reasons. That would be the libertarian argument. We're just gonna let those play out. Well,

00:24:58I don't want people to get hurt.

McIntosh:00:25:01Besides, it's make it's difficult to make a theory of work as a

00:25:04governmental currency, but, anyways,

00:25:07not to get off and all that.

00:25:09So

00:25:10we will see how Argentina handles this. It is a step, which is good. It is a break from what they've done for a long time, which is probably a really good thing.

00:25:22I

00:25:23do hope that Argentina

00:25:27starts to turn around.

00:25:29I would love to see Argentina be like El Salvador.

00:25:34Be on some Bitcoin standard,

00:25:36Bitcoin friendly,

00:25:39friendly for Bitcoin investors,

00:25:41friendly for people who want to move there,

Unknown:00:25:45because of Bitcoin laws there,

00:25:48tapping

00:25:49their massive,

00:25:51massive

00:25:52hydropower resources

00:25:55for Bitcoin mining.

00:25:56To Bitfarms, I know, for example, this will be something I will be following closely.

McIntosh:00:26:02I do own stock in Bitfarms.

00:26:05They recently announced. They agreed,

00:26:08made an agreement with the Argentinian

00:26:11government or the

00:26:13energy company that runs

00:26:15which is a governmental

00:26:17run agency, if I'm not mistaken.

00:26:21For the next 6 months

00:26:23during their wet season, I guess, and if I got that wrong, I'm sorry.

00:26:28It's I do know it's summer down there, which I don't know why that'd be the wet season.

00:26:32But, anyways, it's the cheaper time, I guess.

00:26:35They've negotiated

00:26:37I think it was 2¢ per kilowatt,

00:26:41power, which is incredible. I mean, I I would just die if I had that kind of power. I'd just die and go to heaven. Just be like, I'm done. I can't get any cheaper power than that.

Unknown:00:26:51Anyways,

00:26:53they've got a lot of work to do.

00:26:55They do.

McIntosh:00:26:58It will be interesting watching them over the next few years. I do hope to make it there. Of course, I hope to make it a lot of places. So me just saying that,

00:27:05maybe not the

00:27:07best indicator that I'm going to go there.

Unknown:00:27:10I'd love to go into Buenos Aires. I'd love to go up into the,

00:27:16Patagonian area, lower down.

00:27:20I'd love to spend time even on the, Andean

00:27:23mountains

00:27:24there, the Andes,

00:27:28between Chile

00:27:29and Argentina, maybe jump over into,

McIntosh:00:27:33the area that goes down into Santiago,

00:27:36there's some really interesting places here that I would love to see.

00:27:41To be honest,

00:27:43just being truthful.

00:27:45It will not be this year. It will not be next year. I've got other plans for next year, but maybe maybe down the road.

00:27:54And if they really start to turn things around, then, you know,

00:27:58maybe at some point down the road, there's some investment

00:28:01there. It would be great. I would love to see that country grow.

00:28:07So,

00:28:08Macintosh, why are you doing this? Why are you talking about other countries again? You do this. You go off. You talk about this. Talk about that.

Unknown:00:28:16Why?

McIntosh:00:28:18Good question.

00:28:20 I'm glad you thought of it.

Unknown:00:28:24Here's the answer.

00:28:26It's important because

McIntosh:00:28:29I know that the 100 and however many odds, 60 or 90

Unknown:00:28:34odd countries in the world

00:28:36cannot continue

00:28:38the way that they are. They cannot

00:28:41mathematically,

00:28:43socially.

McIntosh:00:28:46And by mathematically, I mean, the amount of debt that they have. United States, a 125%

00:28:51whatever debt to GDP.

00:28:54Bank, bank.

00:28:56Japan,

00:28:57worse, you know, so on and so forth.

00:29:01That can't continue. Socially, the countries there are so many countries in the world

Unknown:00:29:06right now,

00:29:08that are tearing themselves apart.

McIntosh:00:29:11There has to be a change, and it's either going to get a lot worse

00:29:15and then get better possibly,

00:29:17or it's going to get a lot worse and then get even worse or it's going to get better.

00:29:23Does that make sense? I think that's kind of the three outcomes.

00:29:28Countries

00:29:29like

00:29:31Argentina.

00:29:33Countries

00:29:34like El Salvador

00:29:35can lead the way,

00:29:38and they can show the world, the United States, Russia, Canada,

00:29:43Western Europe,

00:29:44whoever.

00:29:46This is working.

00:29:49You,

00:29:50whoever you country your country,

00:29:52will have to make a change. How are they going to do that?

00:29:56Are they going to become more disruptive and fight with other countries over resources

00:30:02and

00:30:04strip more money from their citizens

00:30:06and cause more

00:30:09chaos by the I mean,

00:30:11the banks are starting to close down accounts if you're talking about

00:30:16crypto. I mean, it's just

00:30:19the insanity

00:30:20is is like ratcheting up,

Unknown:00:30:23and I don't think we're making it up. I think this stuff is going on.

00:30:28It has to change.

00:30:30So the reason why I talk about these countries

00:30:33that I have hoped for

00:30:35is because I want them to lead the way.

00:30:39Not only that,

00:30:41these are countries now, Argentina.

00:30:44Yes, Argentina has had a lot of inflation,

McIntosh:00:30:47but there was a time when Buenos Aires was considered to be the Paris of

00:30:52of the,

00:30:53whichever direction it is, of the east

00:30:56of, to the east.

00:30:58Not saying that right. Certainly of Latin America. How about that? We'll go with that.

00:31:03It was a beautiful city. Not that it is not now, but, you know, it was

00:31:08cultured. It was

00:31:10there was so much economic activity going on. It was prosperous. That's the word I'm trying to say,

Unknown:00:31:18and it's not right now.

00:31:20It can become that again. Wow. We just printed two blocks.

00:31:25You've got to be kidding me. That's crazy.

00:31:28So

00:31:29817,5

00:31:3069

00:31:31was a minute ago, and then, like, just now,

00:31:35817,570.

McIntosh:00:31:37So we printed, like, three blocks in three minutes.

00:31:43That's that's a lot. That's kinda weird.

00:31:47Hey. With statistics, that's the way it works out. Remember, this is not locked to ten minutes, it's

00:31:53there's well, solving a puzzle is not the right way to put it, but, anyways,

00:31:58it's just chance, so these things happen.

00:32:02I wonder if

00:32:03brains mind any of those. Excuse me for just a second.

00:32:07Gonna jump on

00:32:09and take a look

00:32:10because I can't help myself.

00:32:12I need, like, an app that every time I get a block, it just kinda beeps me.

00:32:17Beep.

00:32:18You made money.

00:32:20Beep.

00:32:21Unfortunately,

00:32:22no.

00:32:24Well, that's sad.

00:32:29So as I talk about these countries, I'm I'm doing my best, frankly, to cheerlead them,

00:32:35if that makes sense.

00:32:37I want them to win. I want these countries in Africa to win.

00:32:42I am always about an underdog. That's why I talk about

00:32:46a Bhutan.

00:32:47I think Bhutan made a fabulous choice,

00:32:52spectacular

00:32:52by investing, I think, 100,000,000

00:32:55US dollars

00:32:56into Bitcoin mining operations in the Himalayas because, hey, it's cold.

00:33:01We don't have to worry about our miners overheating.

00:33:04We've got lots of hydroelectric

00:33:06power. Hey. Let's hook it up and

00:33:09build some sound money.

00:33:12Yeah. Anyways, enough about that. As you know, I'm you know?

00:33:17Just to wrap this,

00:33:20BlackRock,

00:33:20they're gonna make their millions. They're gonna make their 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000.

Unknown:00:33:26I'm just as worried about the people

00:33:28out

McIntosh:00:33:30on the border of Chile and Argentina

00:33:33in that Andean mountain region.

00:33:36God forbid I'm saying that wrong. I hope not.

00:33:39Who?

00:33:40They're experiencing

00:33:42a 145%

00:33:43roughly inflation.

Unknown:00:33:47And unlike Diego, who we talked about who they can swap to dollars, and yes, it's it's a huge mess and

00:33:55it is not good for their business, but

00:33:58these people out in the sticks, so to speak, as we would say,

00:34:02they can't do that.

00:34:05That's why Argentina needs sound money,

McIntosh:00:34:08and then they need that transition so that

00:34:11the people in the sticks

00:34:13understand how to use

00:34:15the Bitcoin blockchain.

00:34:17You know, we

00:34:18we act like it's no big deal.

00:34:21It is for a lot of people.

00:34:23I hope that made sense. I think it all did. It all did in my head.

00:34:29It shouldn't yours.

00:34:32Sorry.

Unknown:00:34:35Yeah.

00:34:36Yeah.

McIntosh:00:34:38So good luck. Seriously,

00:34:40Argentina.

00:34:44Alright. Let's talk about our supporters,

00:34:47Kyrin. Kryin sent in a funny message this week. He sent in a,

00:34:51row of ducks boost 2,222.

00:34:54This was for episode 144. I want my right to mix,

Unknown:00:34:59the last episode.

McIntosh:00:35:01And I appreciate that boost, Kyrin, of course. He said

00:35:05I had to Kyrin, to be honest before I read this, I had to go back and listen.

00:35:12I had to go back and listen to the entire episode. It actually happens near the end of the episode, at least the end of my discussion,

00:35:19the topic

00:35:21to to kinda pick up on on what this was about.

00:35:25He said, That pause after, quote, attack the government, quote, is going to get you put on

00:35:31so. And there's, like, 1, 2, 3,

00:35:344,

00:35:355 hoes, mini list. I'm like, what are you talking about?

00:35:40And that's literally what I said. It's a little taken out of context, and I did pause

00:35:47just so everyone's clear,

00:35:51in case I haven't mentioned it anytime soon.

00:35:54As I get older, as I my children get older, to be honest,

00:35:59I find myself becoming more and more of a pacifist.

00:36:02When I was 21, I probably had a a different outlook than I do now. In fact, I know I did.

00:36:09And,

00:36:10 I would never call

00:36:12for violence against

00:36:14any government, and sometimes that's extremely difficult,

Unknown:00:36:19for taking of human life over political

00:36:23things.

McIntosh:00:36:25The only time,

00:36:27personally, to be honest, is, that I would believe in that is if you showed up at my house

00:36:32trying to rob and beat and,

Unknown:00:36:36you know, various sundry other things

00:36:38in my house,

McIntosh:00:36:40you know, personal defense type things.

00:36:45You'll find out I'm not a pacifist when it comes to that.

00:36:49So I guess I just got put on 14 more list,

00:36:53Kyrin.

00:36:55Fortunately, here in the United States, I don't think we've quite sunk to that level unless maybe you live in California,

Unknown:00:37:01but

McIntosh:00:37:03I just pray for the people in California. I don't know what to tell them,

00:37:08But

00:37:09I I would there

00:37:11there's lines that when they get crossed

00:37:14that I will vote with my feet.

00:37:17I'm also aware that a lot of people can't do that, unfortunately.

00:37:22So I guess I'm in a,

Unknown:00:37:24privileged position, if you wanna call it that.

McIntosh:00:37:27I just know that there's a lot of people who can't necessarily get up and move

00:37:32if

00:37:33their country does something that they just completely don't agree with, and they think that that's

00:37:38what they should do.

00:37:40But they can't because they

00:37:42they have no money because their peso is inflated

00:37:46at a 145%.

00:37:48I'm

00:37:49sorry if if that sound like I was making fun of Argentina. I'm not. I'm

Unknown:00:37:53just trying to

00:37:56proved my point because those people,

00:37:59again,

McIntosh:00:38:02who are out in the in the sticks says we would say here in the United States who, you know, they can't afford

Unknown:00:38:07to move

00:38:08if

00:38:09because of that. And I'm

McIntosh:00:38:11I don't know. It's it's an extremely difficult position.

00:38:16Anyways,

00:38:17so

00:38:18I did not certainly, literally, me attack the government.

Unknown:00:38:22So there you go. I guess maybe a little bit more about about McIntosh and about what goes on in in his head.

McIntosh:00:38:29It's convoluted. I'll tell you that. My head's

00:38:32man.

Unknown:00:38:33The older I get, the more confused I get really, and it should be the opposite, which is

00:38:39not

00:38:40good. Maybe.

00:38:41I don't know.

00:38:43Life's hard sometimes.

McIntosh:00:38:45It's the way it is.

00:38:46Alright. Anyways, wow.

00:38:48Kyrin, appreciate that. We're gonna move right along now.

00:38:52Got a couple of anonymous boost, which these are

00:38:55starting to get to be regular. I don't know if it's the same person.

00:38:58I really appreciate it. Anonymous, whoever you are.

00:39:02It's rather cool, actually, that you're boosting anonymously,

00:39:05and, literally, I have no way of knowing who you are. I don't even know what app you came from.

00:39:10That does not show up, so that's

Unknown:00:39:12great.

00:39:14500 sat boost,

00:39:16episode 143.

00:39:18Are you in the right mindset?

00:39:20No message.

00:39:21And then a 100 sat boost,

McIntosh:00:39:23episode 144, I want my right to mix. So I appreciate both of those. If they were from the same person, I'm pretty sure that they are,

00:39:30the total support was 2,772

00:39:33sets. So I do appreciate that. That was awesome.

00:39:37Yes. I I do appreciate

00:39:39the treasure

00:39:40that was shared here with generation Bitcoin.

00:39:44I would like to share some with the listeners, and here's how we can do this. I mentioned from time to time, most weeks,

00:39:52if you clip an episode and what I mean is if you go to app like fountain and you clip

00:39:581, 2, 3 minute clip

00:40:01from the episode. If it's the current episode, it's a 500 sat boost back to you.

00:40:07If it's

00:40:09an older episode,

00:40:10then it's 300 sats. It's a way for you to make some treasure. It's a way for you to make some sats

00:40:17from me, So you're welcome to do that.

00:40:20Based on last week's recommendation,

00:40:22I've actually started doing.

00:40:27I think I told you I might be doing this last week, but I implemented it. I've started implementing it. I'm splitting up my podcast across multiple

00:40:37apps. I should have done this

00:40:39previously.

00:40:40So now I have fountain, which I've used traditionally,

00:40:44podcast guru, which I'm really liking. I will say

00:40:48sometimes

00:40:48the

00:40:49the UI, maybe not quite what I expect. I'm

00:40:53managing to get around, but,

00:40:56but, you know, it is solid. It is very quick. I will say that. Definitely.

00:41:01I think it has a very bright future. And then also, Podverse, which I have used just in the past.

00:41:08Looks like they just got a new version came out, 4.15.0.

00:41:15If you're on the beta test, I guess,

00:41:17you can click with Podverse. I can I know that you can do that?

00:41:21You may have to let me know if you do that. I won't get automatically

00:41:25noticed.

00:41:26I won't automatically notice it if you do it on there. But I am I've got, like, 10 on here. I'm trying to get, like, 10 podcasts on each one to kinda spread this around,

00:41:36test out the different podcasts so maybe I can help people if they need help, give suggestions,

00:41:41or just see what's out there regardless.

00:41:45So I'm now on three different ones. I'll probably bring on in 1 more this week and keep pulling stuff off of fountain. Fountain had been overloaded.

00:41:54So we'll see how that experiment goes. News

00:41:58and links. Alright. I do wanna cover a bit of news, if you follow me on Twitter,

00:42:03I'm on @McintoshFintech. I post kind of in real time as I see these things come up.

00:42:10Of course, I've already talked about Javier Milei.

Unknown:00:42:12He is the new president.

McIntosh:00:42:15I posted about a video. This is what I was talking about. Ministry of Culture out, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development out, so

Unknown:00:42:23on and so forth. It's just like

00:42:26Ministry of Public Works,

McIntosh:00:42:31Ministry of Science Technology Innovation.

00:42:33Look. I'm not saying that some of these are not bad things. I mean, like, maybe,

00:42:38I don't know, environmental,

00:42:40what, Ministry of Transportation.

00:42:42We probably need that.

00:42:44We need transportation. We need a transportation

00:42:47policy, I should say, in a nation.

00:42:50But

00:42:52these things, they take over. They get a life of their own.

00:42:55And so

00:42:58I you know, in a country that's at a 145%

00:43:01inflation

00:43:03that is printing money like no tomorrow,

00:43:05they have to do these kind of things just to stop the bleeding. They have to figure out,

00:43:11you know, what's what can we trim back? And then maybe at some point, if they need something,

00:43:17they add it back, but you've got to build a solid base. And right now, they don't have that. So, anyways,

00:43:24interesting stuff there.

00:43:27I thought this was interesting. This guy named wicked,

00:43:31w_s_bitcoin

00:43:34that I follow, he posted this.

00:43:39And he said, you may not like this, but within the next few years, I bet one of the 1st Bitcoin mints and what he's talking about, I believe, is like stablecoin

00:43:47on

00:43:48Bitcoin.

00:43:50Of lightning maybe

00:43:51with Taproot,

00:43:52for example, will emerge that becomes highly trusted and lasts for centuries. You don't you won't have to trust it, but many will, and they'll be fine. So this is kind of the argument. Well, we want Bitcoin to be noncustodial.

00:44:05That's certainly

00:44:07absolutely the best. But with

00:44:10the number of people in the world, with the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, it will be necessary,

00:44:16is this argument that that there are trusted

00:44:19institutions

00:44:20essentially

00:44:21that that we use for Bitcoin services, and

00:44:25it's going to happen whether you like it or not.

00:44:28It remains to be seen how stable those are,

00:44:32and some of them will not last. But

00:44:36it will be part of the fabric, and you're just you will have to deal with that.

00:44:41Not everybody can afford a $10 on chain fee. I mean, just that's just not gonna happen.

00:44:48So, anyways,

00:44:50thought that was interesting.

00:44:51He also pointed,

00:44:53he also posted earlier today.

00:44:56For the first time ever,

00:44:57more than 70%,

00:44:597 0% of all Bitcoin

00:45:01has been hodled

00:45:03or or held in cold storage for more than one year. That's incredible.

Unknown:00:45:09Strike,

McIntosh:00:45:10some updates, you can read about that as well.

00:45:14More ways of getting money,

00:45:16fiat into the system, in the form of Bitcoin.

00:45:21Getting money out.

00:45:23You know, of course, this is a

00:45:25KYC service,

00:45:27but it is available

00:45:29virtually all over the globe.

00:45:32Fidelity who they're a huge asset manager,

00:45:35and they've been very vocal about their Bitcoin support.

00:45:39Said if powering Bitcoin, a global digital monetary network, is considered wasteful,

00:45:45then what does that make the traditional financial system? For some context,

00:45:49Fidelity is part of the traditional financial system.

00:45:53It's one of the world's it's one of the largest financial institutes in North America. Every day, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is the best asset

00:46:03that we have, large financial institutions are coming out to say this BlackRock.

00:46:08These are some of the wealthiest people and organizations in the world. So,

00:46:12yes. I do believe that 2025

00:46:152024,

00:46:16excuse me,

00:46:17will be the year

00:46:19of the institution.

00:46:21Last year this year, excuse me,

00:46:24year of regulation,

00:46:25and I've been pretty accurate about that. That regulation will continue.

00:46:31Some of it we may not like. In fact, maybe a lot of it we don't like, but it will continue. But next year will be the year of the institution.

00:46:38And I don't mean MicroStrategy.

00:46:40I mean,

00:46:41BlackRock. I mean,

00:46:44Fidelity. I mean, these type companies, ETFs will come online, and they even if they're approved at this point before the end of the year, which is not guaranteed,

00:46:55they will not come online until next year. So I'm going to go on record right now

00:47:01prior to January 1st saying that next year will be the year

00:47:05of the institution

00:47:06becoming involved

00:47:08in Bitcoin in a big, big way.

00:47:11And one more, I had to throw this in, Peruvian bull, which is

00:47:15Peruvian

00:47:16underscore bull.

00:47:17Said

00:47:18this.

00:47:20CPI was lower than expectations

00:47:22because

00:47:23health insurance costs were, checks, notes,

00:47:26down 38%.

00:47:28Who actually believes this crap? So what he's talking about,

00:47:31our CPI numbers came out this week, and

00:47:34they were lower. They were, like, 3.8 instead of 3.9 or whatever it was percent inflation.

00:47:41And one of the big things was health insurance was down 38%.

00:47:45I promise you health insurance costs have not got suddenly gone down 38%

00:47:50year over year in the United States. That is complete and other baloney.

00:47:54I have no idea how they even came up with that, but that's the kind of stuff that they use to skew the data. It's crazy.

00:48:03So I believe I've mentioned this, the parliament the EU parliament

00:48:08had a bill come up before it essentially, and that maybe they don't call it a bill, but it's a bill at least in our lingo,

00:48:16about

00:48:17chat surveillance,

00:48:18essentially,

00:48:19warrantless mass surveillance of phones and circumventing end to end encryption.

00:48:24Fortunately, with an overwhelming 51 to 2 vote, the parliament has decided against that. So that's really good news for the EU.

00:48:32I'm proud of y'all. I have no idea how your system works if you

00:48:36called your congressman or whatever,

00:48:39your parliament member. I apologize

00:48:41for my naive to tell you, but I promise

00:48:44I would bet most of you don't actually know how our system works either. So, hey, it goes both ways. Right?

00:48:51But we'll fumble through it. Anyways, that's really good

00:48:55that y'all did that. So great news.

00:48:58And here in back in the US, $8,200,000,000,000

00:49:02of US debt will be maturing

00:49:04in the next 12 months. So what that means is that debt will roll over,

00:49:09and it will roll over at a higher interest rate. So

00:49:13more interest will be generated

00:49:15that will have to be paid as part of our debt, and we're already

00:49:20approaching if not at $1,000,000,000,000

00:49:22a year in interest alone on the federal

00:49:26debt. It's insane.

00:49:28It's insane. It's insanity.

00:49:31Alright. There we go. That's it. That's what I had for the news.

00:49:35I've told y'all before this is time of year. Things just kinda slow up a little bit.

00:49:40No ETF news this week. No real crazy things. The SEC did actually

00:49:46ask a few of the ETF

00:49:49companies who wanted the ETFs

00:49:51basically to make some changes

00:49:54to their,

00:49:56their plan,

00:49:59which actually

00:50:00were beneficial towards Bitcoin. I'm not really gonna go into that. It's kind of in the weed stuff, but it was a good thing. I'm not sure that these will be approved before the end of the year. I'm quite confident that they will be approved.

Unknown:00:50:12You can argue

00:50:13whether they're good or bad. They are happening.

McIntosh:00:50:17Now we can the price will benefit. We all know that.

00:50:21Is it best for Bitcoin?

00:50:23It's not best for Bitcoin for those people. That's not the best way to own Bitcoin, but I'd rather they do that than own, I don't know,

00:50:33Microsoft stonker.

00:50:35Chat API

00:50:37GPT.

00:50:38Sorry. Chat GPT.

00:50:40I think that's a better bet,

00:50:44So I'm okay with it from that perspective. Does it violate Bitcoin? Does it

00:50:49circumvent the rules? Does it you know? No. It's

Unknown:00:50:53all proper legal,

00:50:55you know, the way that it

00:50:56it's operating within the protocol rules, so therefore,

00:50:59it's like ordinals. I I hate ordinals,

00:51:03but

McIntosh:00:51:05ordinals are allowed.

00:51:06And until that changes, if consensus is given and that's changed.

00:51:11Then they're there, and they're cluttering up the mining blocks and causing high fees and,

00:51:17but that high fees may drive innovation.

00:51:20We're much better prepared than we were in 2017,

00:51:23for example, for high fees, and we will have high fees. This bull run. I promise you.

00:51:29People are gonna be crying over these rates.

00:51:31You should be getting prepared. We will talk about that. I've already said that. You really do need to be getting prepared. If you've got lightning channels,

00:51:39you need to get them.

00:51:40You need to make sure that those are the size that they need to be, and that includes your Phoenix wallet, by the way, if you happen to use that

00:51:48or some such custodial

00:51:50setup

00:51:51because people are finding, oh, I'm trying to send this tiny little thing to my

00:51:57lightning wallet, and it's charging a $10 fee. Well, it's because it's having to splice in a channel,

00:52:03and it's

00:52:04expanding it, so it's doing an on chain transaction. Well, the on chain transactions or off the chain.

00:52:12That's probably not a good way to say that, but they're really high.

00:52:15So therefore, they get charged for that. So you need to think about these things now,

00:52:20not when the fees are double, triple what they are

00:52:23even though they're already high. So that's it.

00:52:27That's what we got.

00:52:28Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2 point o. We are a value for value podcast. I do not have sponsors. I do not have advertising. I've actually done a lot of thought about this.

00:52:39I'm currently not going to do that.

00:52:42Maybe I'll talk about this. I'm not gonna do this tonight, but there's a point in time I wanna talk about this. I've actually found out some interesting things. For example,

00:52:51one of my favorite podcasts. I'm gonna throw this out real quick, and then I'm gonna wrap this up. I'm gonna skip a lot of this.

00:52:57One of my favorite podcasts I listen to. So I'm a token fanatic and

00:53:02lord of the rings, simrillion,

00:53:04the hobbit, you know, all the back material, all this stuff.

00:53:08I'm a fanatic. I read it

00:53:11more than I should.

00:53:13And, so I listened to this podcast. It's called the prancing pony, which was the name of,

00:53:19let's see. That was the name of the

00:53:22in in Bree. Cute little name. Prancing Pony.

00:53:25Show's been around for a long time. They have 12,000

00:53:29downloads or users, whatever, listeners is what he called it, 12,000 listeners.

00:53:33I assume that means per episode. I assume that means on a regular basis,

00:53:39But they do, you know,

00:53:42a bucket load

00:53:44of

00:53:45advertising.

00:53:46Like, you wade through, like, 3 minutes of advertising up front and then, like, 2 minutes in the middle, and it's ridiculous.

00:53:54They're clearly not value for value. They're certainly not value for value. They do not stream sets.

Unknown:00:53:59They don't, you know, accept boost, anything like that.

00:54:02That's not my point.

McIntosh:00:54:06I'm not at 12,000

00:54:07downloads per episode, 12,000 listeners, however you wanna put it. I'm not. I'm a long way from there, but I could see one day being at that point.

Unknown:00:54:17I do not know. We will see when I get to that point how the value for value side of this is doing.

00:54:24I would hope it's doing much better than it is now

00:54:27because as I provide value, I would hope that people would give that value back.

00:54:33But I also know that

00:54:35with 12,000

00:54:36downloads, you know, they have

00:54:402 hosts, they have

00:54:42an audio editor. They have

00:54:45community support. They have all this stuff that that they do. So they clearly are making a lot of money off of their advertising. So

00:54:54I don't know.

McIntosh:00:54:56I know there's a lot of stuff that I will never touch.

00:55:00You'll never see me hawk

00:55:02ledger wallets.

00:55:04Now I have no problem talking about seed signer, which is an open source product,

00:55:10which you literally can buy the pieces and put yourself

00:55:13together. But I would not even take money from seed signer if they offered it to me.

00:55:19Because if there were ever a problem, I do not want my listeners to come back to me and say, Macintosh,

00:55:26you told us to use seed signer, and we did, and we lost money.

00:55:30Why did you do that? Well, first of all, I'll never tell you to do seed signer. I will tell you I use seed signer. I'm about to order 1 for my mining business because I need it. But I'm not gonna tell you to do that. I'm just gonna lay out why it might work for you.

00:55:46And I want no financial gain from that if you go to seed signer because that will absolutely

00:55:52sway my opinion.

00:55:54So there are a lot of things that I will never

00:55:57never

00:55:59think about as a sponsor. Is there a time maybe when I would take sponsors who are

00:56:06I can't even think of the problem is I can't think of anything. I'm sure there are.

00:56:11I don't know. Maybe a seed plate

00:56:15where you put your seed,

00:56:18words into aluminum plates or steel, stainless steel. I don't know how you could possibly go wrong with that, and maybe I wouldn't have any problem,

00:56:27quote shilling that. I don't know.

00:56:30We'll see.

Unknown:00:56:31I'm also very aware of what it sounds like when you have ads in the middle of your

00:56:36material. Even if it's a kind of a

McIntosh:00:56:39what do they call it? A native ad where you kinda mix it in. Oh, I those actually could be the most nefarious where, oh, you don't know that they're getting paid to do that.

Unknown:00:56:49I don't know.

McIntosh:00:56:51Anyways,

00:56:52we don't have any sponsors, and we don't have any advertising. We do depend on the listener. There's 3 different ways you can do that, time, talent, or treasure.

00:57:01Go out, try one of these podcast 2 point o apps if you haven't.

00:57:06Fountain,

00:57:08podcast

00:57:09guru

00:57:10or Podverse.

00:57:12Most of you probably do listen to a lot of podcasts. Maybe you could do, like, what I'm doing where I kind of split it up, and I'll see how they work for me.

00:57:20But if you have a podcasting 2 point o app, then you can support a show like ours. You can boost. You can send messages.

Unknown:00:57:26You can stream,

McIntosh:00:57:29to the show as well. Stream stats

00:57:31to support the show just like anonymous did earlier and Kyron did earlier.

00:57:37Anyways,

00:57:38enough about that. I rattled on enough tonight. I do appreciate y'all being here. I am very much

00:57:43can I be honest? I hope I can be honest.

00:57:46I'm very much looking forward to this time off. Not I will miss doing this,

00:57:52But the commitment that it takes to do this twice a week,

00:57:55especially for months on end, and I do, again, apologize. I say twice a week, and then, McIntosh, you weren't on last Thursday. Well,

00:58:03that was life.

00:58:04These things do happen from time to time,

00:58:07but it's pretty rare.

00:58:10It's it's pretty high,

00:58:12and I'm looking forward to this time off. But I'm also,

00:58:15while I'm gonna be gone, I'm going to do some things. I know I'm gonna move the podcast,

Unknown:00:58:20which will help us in the future with the podcast 2 point o stuff.

00:58:24I know.

00:58:26Well,

00:58:27I'll tell you more when I come back in January or the last day of December or whatever I decide to do

00:58:35because

00:58:35we're gonna come back and say

00:58:382024,

00:58:40the year of the institutions.

McIntosh:00:58:44It's so easy when it's so obvious.

00:58:47But, yeah, that's gonna be a big thing next year. There's gonna be a lot of things next year.

00:58:52Next year will be the start of the bull run

00:58:55if we're not already there, and I don't I think we're gonna kinda grind up for the rest of the year

00:59:02unless these ETFs get approved. If they do, all bets off, we may shoot right up

00:59:07for a good bit. We may come back down, but we'll shoot right up.

00:59:11It may kick off that bull market a little early, and I don't know what that would do about the end of it. We'll see.

00:59:18If we do really get going early on, I may have to evaluate

00:59:22Q4 2025.

00:59:25But for now, I'll stick with that.

00:59:27Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful.

00:59:30I would love to hear from you.

00:59:32I always love hearing from y'all.

00:59:35I'm on you can

00:59:37post me a message. That's the most direct way to get ahold of me. I'm also on Twitter at Macintosh Fintech.

00:59:43As long as I don't get kicked off or maybe you I don't know. I'm on at

00:59:48Macintosh at podcast index dot social as well.

00:59:53That's it. Stay humble friends. Go out. Make it a great week. I'll talk to y'all soon.
