McIntosh and Kenshin return after a two-week holiday break to discuss their predictions for 2026. They commemorate the 17th anniversary of Bitcoin's Genesis block (January 3, 2009) and discuss the upcoming anniversary of the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney. Kenshin surprises by flipping bullish for 2026 despite his previous bearish stance, while both hosts share personal goals including potential career changes. They cover Bitcoin Core bugs, Ledger security breaches, and debate whether the four-year cycle pattern will finally break.
