McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, Sat Stackers, today is November 26th, and this is episode 147 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host,

00:00:08Mcintosh, and today's episode is the final countdown.

00:00:41I hope,

00:00:42I hope you had

00:00:44Europe's final countdown playing in your head.

00:00:47You know? Whatever. Sorry. That was bad. But, yeah, with all apologies to Europe, the band. We are marking

00:00:57next episode

00:01:00Will be our last as generation Bitcoin.

00:01:04In the stretch,

00:01:05we will have an episode on

00:01:08the 30th,

00:01:09if all goes well,

00:01:11or the 31st if I get delayed for some reason

00:01:14as it happens sometimes with my work. And then we'll be taking the month of December off as I've explained.

00:01:21The next episode,

00:01:22I will be revealing the new name. I

00:01:25I registered it yesterday,

00:01:28and,

00:01:29I will be preparing that website

00:01:31and

00:01:32all of that. And at some point during that time,

00:01:36during the month off,

00:01:38the site will move probably fairly early, actually.

00:01:42The podcast itself will move

McIntosh:00:01:44over to the new name. So

00:01:46but that's for next week.

McIntosh:00:01:49Market update.

00:01:51To market update, we had a weekly close a few hours ago, 37,400

00:01:56and 54.

00:01:57If you go back and look at the chart that I've drawn,

00:02:01we are tracking

00:02:03right on target.

McIntosh:00:02:05We have spent

00:02:07interesting little

00:02:09thing that happened here.

00:02:11Essentially, the weekend

McIntosh:00:02:14Above

00:02:15above our our level of support

00:02:18resistance

00:02:19at 37,500.

McIntosh:00:02:22.

00:02:23And then tonight, we kind of fell below it.

McIntosh:00:02:26We closed the week

00:02:29at, like I said,

00:02:3137,454,

00:02:34slightly below that 37,500.

00:02:37We are still below it.

00:02:39It could pop back above it, but, you know, we've nicely went up and touched the upper part of that ascending channel.

00:02:47We are very strongly looking like this ascending channel is going to play out. So it may you know, it it could possibly still

00:02:54absolutely go down

00:02:56thirty six six.

00:02:58Maybe a little bit higher depending on how far into the week that we are.

00:03:04But the time is coming when this

00:03:07bottom part of the channel, so to speak, will force it upwards. I mean,

00:03:12It's either that or it falls out and

00:03:15which is

00:03:16statistically

00:03:17unlikely.

00:03:18So I'm suggesting

00:03:20that, you know,

00:03:21We're looking at basically

00:03:23very early December,

00:03:26somewhere around 3rd, 4th, 5th.

00:03:29It's going to be forced above this level of 37,500

00:03:33if it hasn't already

00:03:36permanently established itself above that or at least semi permanently,

00:03:41whatever. But,

00:03:43but, yeah, we'll we'll see how this works out, but

00:03:46The

00:03:48the pattern that we discussed last week still in play. We've still got this upward channel. We're still

00:03:53well within that. We're Actually, right in the middle of it right now.

00:03:58We are below that level of resistance

00:04:02for now at 37,500

00:04:05Ish,

00:04:06and you'll see that we've we've spent a good bit of time here.

00:04:11It will be very interesting. I think this will prove to be a Pretty solid level of support once we get above it, but we will see.

00:04:19So, of course, as always, that is not trading advice. I'm not trading this. I do not suggest that you trade this. As always,

00:04:27I suggest

00:04:29that what you should do

00:04:31is DCA.

00:04:33I

00:04:34saw a chart this week, which I have mentioned in the past. If you've

00:04:39since the top

00:04:4169,000,

00:04:43that

00:04:44you are actually in profit,

00:04:46which would be a pretty good place to be considering the price of Bitcoin that it is right now.

00:04:52In other words,

00:04:53you've started buying Bitcoin at $5 a day, $10 a day, Whatever it is, $100

00:05:00a day. I don't know.

00:05:02But you've been doing that since 69,000,

00:05:06And here we are $30,000

00:05:09below that and you're in profit. That's what DCA

00:05:12Bitcoin will do for you.

00:05:14So don't forget that. Don't you know, we do these chart patterns, and it's fun, and

00:05:20it gives us an idea of maybe where things are gonna Go in the market.

00:05:25But this isn't trading advice. This isn't a trading podcast.

00:05:30I'm not some trading guru,

00:05:32Anything like that.

00:05:34I want you to keep that in mind.

00:05:36Always. DCA. Alright. The difficulty adjustment happened on the 26th.

00:05:42It did happen.

00:05:43Yes.

00:05:45Which would be today,

00:05:4825th.

00:05:49Excuse me. The last adjustment was on the 25th.

00:05:53It must have happened late on 25th.

00:05:56Pretty sure it was saying 26 earlier was when it was estimated.

00:06:01But regardless, it happened on the 25th,

00:06:035.07%,

00:06:06so another upward increase. I think this was

00:06:10it's been quite a few now that it's been upward.

00:06:13We've had more hash coming in. We've had new servers coming online.

00:06:18It's no longer summer, so at least here in the upper in the Northern Hemisphere. So,

00:06:25you know,

00:06:26the large areas of Texas that, you know,

00:06:29massive numbers of minors are being turned on and off

00:06:32for energy reasons,

00:06:35during the heat of the Texas summer that's come to an end.

00:06:40So we're all and and Bitcoin price is up, so older miners are getting put back online.

00:06:47The mining dip that is why the mining difficulty keeps ratcheting up, just to be clear.

McIntosh:00:06:52So

McIntosh:00:06:54And our block height, by the way, I I if I haven't said this earlier, our block height at time of recording is 818-653.

McIntosh:00:07:01I must have already said that.

00:07:04Alright.

McIntosh:00:07:05Let's go through the rest of these statistics.

00:07:08We do have the having coming up in April.

00:07:11Looking like it would be around April 23rd,

00:07:14so we're kind of narrowing that in.

00:07:17Fees.

00:07:19Let me bring up mempool.space.

00:07:22Fees have been high, but not as high as they have been. Right now, we're looking at

00:07:2958, 67, and 77 sats per v byte. So a little bit lower than they have been, but the pool is definitely

00:07:37Still full. We're at 1.21

00:07:39gigabytes.

00:07:40I think I saw it sneak down into the twenties at 1 point very briefly.

00:07:46Alright. So let's jump on in.

00:07:50As I said,

00:07:51next episode will be the last one.

00:07:54I had a realization today. It's kind of funny.

McIntosh:00:08:00I was listening to the Bitcoin

00:08:02Dad podcast. And,

McIntosh:00:08:05so the Bitcoin Dad and a guy named Chris from Juniper,

00:08:09Networks,

00:08:11who he was the founder of Juniper Networks,

00:08:15creator of Juniper Networks, and, does a number of podcasts including,

00:08:20I wanna say Linux unplugged,

00:08:23and a number of others. But, anyways,

00:08:26they do a weekly podcast, and

McIntosh:00:08:32I realized

00:08:33that

00:08:35Bitcoin Dad was

McIntosh:00:08:37Kind of like a calm version of myself.

00:08:41He they were talking about something,

00:08:43and it was something that well, it was actually the,

00:08:47it's what I just talked about,

00:08:49the the censorship

00:08:51of, transactions by the mempool. And, of course, I get extremely

00:08:56agitated,

00:08:57shall we say, about that,

00:09:00type thing because it's and because it's super important, and

00:09:04I know he believes that it is. It's that's not the case at all. It's just, you know, he Comes across very calm. I thought that was kind of funny. He never I don't think I've ever heard him raise his voice on his podcast. Just one of those thoughts I had. Whatever.

00:09:20But, I also got my seed signer this week.

00:09:24So this is,

00:09:26this will be used for my Bitcoin,

00:09:29mining, which I've discussed in the past

00:09:32to move the mined

00:09:33sets off my mining pool. Of course, I wanted to move them straight into a nice hardware wallet

00:09:41that was set up just for that. I interviewed seed signer, as you all know, a few weeks ago. I've been looking at their product for a while,

00:09:50and I actually bought a nice,

00:09:52It was not the aluminum one. It was the black one. Well, it's,

00:09:56sorry. Not the silver one, the black aluminum.

00:10:00I went ahead and ordered it assembled. I did not assemble this one myself,

00:10:04but I'm going to be putting it together probably this week.

00:10:09I think I wanna take the time to document that at least in terms of a

00:10:14paper,

00:10:15like Blog long form type thing, and then I will be posting that hopefully,

00:10:21on Seth's,

00:10:23Seth for privacy on his new,

00:10:26webpage, which

00:10:28frankly escapes me at the moment, but we talked about it on his episode back in episode 141.

00:10:35So, as a

00:10:37kind of a tutorial,

00:10:39we'll see how all that turns out, but I am looking forward to Putting that together to finishing that up, and,

00:10:47it's a really nice looking device, to be honest. Now I bought the aluminum one. It was a little more expensive.

00:10:53I think this one was $150

00:10:55more or less. It might I think it was a tiny bit more than that with shipping,

00:11:00But, had some nice instructions,

00:11:03had some everything was that you need was in there, the little micro

00:11:07SD card, the, unit itself, of course, which which has the Raspberry Pi,

00:11:14single board computer, or whatever they call it in the box.

00:11:19The the cable that you would need to power it, so it's like a micro

00:11:23USB cable that you connect up to your seed signer, and then maybe you plug it into your

00:11:29into your computer,

00:11:31and it will power it up. Now it only does power. It doesn't actually provide data, and they make that very clear

00:11:38on the documentation.

00:11:39So

00:11:41Very well done. Got QR codes to go with it. Our QR,

00:11:45like, blank QR,

00:11:47pads,

00:11:48And actually a little sticker that said seed signer, which I could choose to stick on my laptop. I probably

00:11:54won't

00:11:55simply

00:11:56Because of the nature of what it is, I really like it, but

00:12:01that's the kind of thing I don't really want advertised,

00:12:03shall we say.

00:12:08Yeah. So there you go.

00:12:10Very cool.

00:12:12Very, very cool. I will provide another report on that,

00:12:16after I get it done, if I get it done before Thursday, which I probably won't,

00:12:22to be honest, I'll talk about it then. Otherwise, I guess it will wait

00:12:26until next year.

00:12:28Just an update,

00:12:30on Argentina

00:12:32as well. Things seem to be progressing sing along down there,

00:12:37probably about as well as we can expect.

00:12:42President,

00:12:43Malay is very intent

00:12:47on shutting down the central bank. He has made that very clear.

McIntosh:00:12:51Hold on just a second. I need

00:12:54to need to get some of my tea.

McIntosh:00:12:57I actually need to take the tea bag out.

00:13:00In my opinion, and I may be mistaken in this or at least this may not one of everyone's opinion. If you leave the tea in there too long, it will make it

00:13:10Almost bitter. I don't know.

00:13:12I like it to a point, and then,

00:13:15you know,

00:13:16I don't want it to be any stronger, essentially.

00:13:20So the tea and the honey,

00:13:23nice. Alright.

00:13:25But, he

00:13:27look. I'll go through some of this when we go through the news. Time will tell. We're very early. He hasn't even taken office yet,

00:13:35But I I'm

00:13:36seeing promising things, frankly. You know? This is a long haul as I always say. I talked about,

00:13:43Bukele, last week or the week before. I mean, here he is

00:13:48running for his second term, and I'm I'm not convinced at this point. I think he's done a lot of good things, but

00:13:55history will will show how this goes.

00:13:59And we are in the middle of it. And it's very difficult

00:14:03to see at this point. So next

00:14:06week will be the last episode of generation Bitcoin.

00:14:09I did get an email back from the Generation Bitcoin people.

00:14:13They will not be coming on the show.

00:14:16That doesn't change anything.

00:14:19They're busy. It's,

00:14:21the time of year when frankly, actually, the person I was

00:14:26Corresponding with I believe she's in a master's program or,

00:14:31bachelor's program,

00:14:32if I'm remembering correctly from Jimmy

00:14:35Jimmy Song's,

00:14:36interview with them. And,

00:14:39so,

00:14:41it's it's finals. I get it. So they won't be coming on,

00:14:46but we will be going forward with

00:14:50the new name. And like I said, I'll be sharing that name next week,

00:14:56but I'm excited about it because I think I finally got

McIntosh:00:15:00Something I I was trying to explain this

00:15:03to my wife last night. I'm not really sure I'm doing a good job of it, but

00:15:09The words mean something. It's something that

00:15:12I think it'll have traction. We'll see. I'm not doing a good job of explaining it, but I'm really looking forward to

McIntosh:00:15:20it. We'll be revealing that next week in case I just haven't said that, like, fourteen times already.

00:15:26But,

00:15:27I'm gonna have a new website.

00:15:29I would like to get a chat server set up. I'm looking at that.

00:15:33It might be a little quiet

00:15:35to start with and frankly probably will be, but I would love to, you know, start building more community. That's one of the things that I'm

00:15:45Really trying to do here.

00:15:48I love the fact that we've got some regulars who

00:15:53Boost in , who, you know,

00:15:55I kinda feel like I understand a little bit about their lives and this kind of thing, and that's terrific. But, we'll go ahead and start actively building community through, you know, through this chat setup. I would also like to

00:16:09start doing,

00:16:12live broadcast.

00:16:16That is something that I'm thinking about as well. Now that's gonna be tricky,

00:16:21and especially considering the way that I

00:16:25Think and talk.

00:16:27What it will mean is that I will have to spend a lot more time and show prep

00:16:33because

00:16:34just to give you a little inside baseball here as we say, typically, what I do is I will sit down and write out an outline of what I'm going to talk about. And

00:16:45so I'm not really winging it,

00:16:48but

00:16:49I am sitting here actively thinking as I'm talking

00:16:54about kinda what I'm gonna say next and this, that, and the other.

00:16:58And what that really does is it slows me down,

00:17:02and so I end up going in and then clipping out a lot of spaces,

00:17:07dead air as I would say, and

00:17:10to to try and tighten it up. Now I'm by nature a fairly slow speaker,

00:17:16but

00:17:17Being put in that position where I'm just, you know, thinking, thinking, thinking for 60 minutes, and it's going to slow me down even more.

00:17:25So if we're gonna do this live

00:17:27to keep things from, you know, grinding to a halt and everybody's saying, oh my

00:17:32Goodness, McIntosh. You could, like, speed this up. I'm going to have to spend more time in show prep. Right? I'm gonna have to

00:17:41Dial in, maybe not rehearsed beforehand

00:17:44really, but, you know, really think through

00:17:46what am I gonna be talking about, Kind of the subtopics

00:17:49of those main topics and all that kind of stuff.

00:17:53So looking forward to that, that will bring in some video as well. I'm Hoping

00:17:59we will see. Not that I'm necessarily interested in having myself plastered all over the Internet, but, I think there's a lot of There's a group of people that really like video. I may be one of those, to be honest,

00:18:13because of the details that it can bring up

00:18:16Across things like when I talk about trading view

00:18:20and show you,

00:18:22you know, how

00:18:23This chart, I mean, yes, I can put it on Twitter

00:18:26or whatever, but

McIntosh:00:18:28it would be a lot easier

McIntosh:00:18:30it would be a lot easier Do this kind of in real time on a video

00:18:34setup.

00:18:35So that's one of the things I'm looking at doing.

00:18:38I have a whole list, actually.

00:18:41December task.

00:18:43Hey. I can mark the first one off. It's not even December. I'm gonna do that right here.

00:18:49Where's the strike through? Done.

00:18:52Register new domain. That has been done. Move podcast. Okay. So I'll be moving

00:18:57over to Castapod.

00:18:59And so when you go

00:19:02to castpod.newdomainname,

00:19:05that will actually take you to

00:19:09where the website,

00:19:10where the podcast will be hosted.

00:19:12If you've ever looked at Castapod,

00:19:14they have some community type functionality built on top of it. But to be honest, it's not super

00:19:21it's not great at this point. I put it that way. So it's not really something I'm gonna Actively be talking about or encouraging.

00:19:28I may set up a,

00:19:31Mastodon

00:19:32instance. I have

00:19:34Thought about that, and that may be certainly

00:19:38possible. So

00:19:39we would possibly do something like mastodon

00:19:42dot new domain name.

00:19:44And then that would take you to the Mastodon instance,

00:19:48and you could join that and use that as to again, to for community building, but as a way to join the Mastodon

00:19:58Federated Universe. So,

00:20:00so Moo podcast set up live video podcast,

00:20:04and we've got a great

00:20:06article.

00:20:07They recently did this at a conference. It was,

00:20:12Blue put it on,

00:20:13and it worked spectacularly

00:20:15from everything that I can tell.

00:20:17So, one of the guys, I think he's CTO of the company, he was kind enough to write a medium article about it, and I have that written down. And then along with a number of other little things

00:20:28kind of in that vein in order to do live video. Now that may not happen

00:20:35right out of the gate, January 1. I'm just gonna be honest,

00:20:38but it is a goal. I'm going to hopefully buy that little,

00:20:43Linux,

00:20:44server I've been talking about for, gosh, a long time, probably most of this year.

00:20:50It's called the BLINK GTR seven Pro is the one that I've decided on. It's an AMD,

00:20:57nice little setup. So I'm planning on

00:20:59running

00:21:00probably Ubuntu on it.

00:21:04So then I would actually run Reaper on that. I would do my live, I've, if I've got video editing software

00:21:11that I need to do for this video stuff, then I will probably have that as well.

00:21:17And then, of course, like I mentioned earlier, I'm gonna try and write an article for Seth's website. So that month, Even though I will not be recording, we'll be extremely busy, and I will get through as much of it as I can.

00:21:31You will still be able to get a hold of me at gendashbtc.com.

00:21:35So that's the Generation Bitcoin website.

00:21:38For the foreseeable future, although I will not retain that domain name forever, there's just no use in doing that.

00:21:45I will move over. Right now, I'm using a WordPress website,

00:21:51which historically is something that I've done a number of times for

00:21:55Other little,

00:21:56for other small businesses that I've helped out.

00:22:00I'm

00:22:01I'm I think I'm gonna do something different, and I haven't decided what yet, but

00:22:06WordPress is kind of

00:22:08I don't know. You look at a WordPress website, and it's like, you know it's WordPress,

00:22:14which is fine. It's just I I would like to be different, maybe. I don't know.

00:22:19That's up in the air. I'm not sure what the point of all that is other than I need to rebuild the website onto the new domain name whether I move WordPress over or choose to do something different.

00:22:31I would also like to get more of a Noster

00:22:34presence.

00:22:35I'm not sure

00:22:37just And I don't talk about Nostra very much on here, but

00:22:41I'm not sure. I love the idea of Nostra,

00:22:45decentralized privacy focused

00:22:48financial rails based on Satoshis.

00:22:50I love all that.

00:22:52I think it has its drawbacks including the fact that there really aren't that many people using it. Although,

00:22:59One nice size side of that is it kinda gives you an outsized,

00:23:05sphere of influence if you're actually using it. So if you're Putting out content there,

00:23:11and people notice it. It's a lot easier to get noticed there than say on Twitter.

00:23:16Even though I tweet

00:23:19Stuff routinely

00:23:21multiple times a day.

00:23:22The reality is some of those most of those get very little traction,

00:23:27and even though there's,

McIntosh:00:23:29I don't know,

00:23:32a 100,000,000

00:23:33maybe Twitter users. I don't I don't know how many? There's a lot.

00:23:38And I have tweets. It'll have 3 or 4 people that'll view it, which is

00:23:43frankly depressing.

McIntosh:00:23:45So,

00:23:46anyways, we'll see. I would I would like to do that. I would love to have something because there's always you got Mastodon.

00:23:52You've got LinkedIn.

00:23:54You've got, Not that I do anything on LinkedIn, but you've got

00:23:59Nostril, you know, you've got multiple

00:24:01platforms. It would be Really great. And I know they're please, you don't need to send me a boost. I know there's stuff that's available that will let you do that

00:24:11Were you kind of blasted out everywhere at once? I don't know. But it gets

00:24:16very tiresome

00:24:18Even just posting

00:24:20when I make a new episode, I've got 3 places I have to go and post that.

00:24:25That'd be something I'd love to solve as well.

00:24:28So hopefully, 2024,

00:24:30regardless

00:24:31of

00:24:32what's going on in the world, which we don't know.

00:24:36In terms of this podcast, I hope that we are moving forward and building

00:24:42a better

00:24:43product,

00:24:44really.

00:24:45I view this as a product in the sense that even though people don't pay me for the ability to listen to it, You know, we're a value for value podcast be in

00:24:57from everything that I can tell, the way that

00:25:00I get more value back whether that's people helping or

00:25:05monetarily through Satoshis.

00:25:07The way that I increase that is by providing

00:25:10a better value experience. Why would I start up another chat server to

00:25:16Something else to deal with. Well, because that's building community. It's providing

00:25:21a better experience

00:25:23and hopefully more

00:25:25value to the listeners who are

00:25:27part of this podcast.

00:25:29That's gonna be my goal, my focus in 2024.

00:25:34Does that make sense? I I hope it does.

00:25:37I think it does. It does to me.

00:25:40So that will be my focus in 2024. We're gonna kick it off here at the end of 2023

00:25:46with as much of this as we can do,

00:25:49and we'll keep rolling from there. I do plan

00:25:53on going to

00:25:54the Bitcoin conference in July in Nashville. I would love to meet up

00:26:00with listeners. I if we have enough people who are going, and I have no idea if we will or not,

00:26:05maybe we could get together at, like, a pizza place or something

00:26:09and just have a little party.

00:26:11I don't know. I haven't that's literally, like, the first time I've thought about about that, but I would at least love to meet up with with people.

00:26:19So

00:26:20alright.

00:26:21Let's see. What else do we have tonight?

00:26:25We should talk about our supporters.

00:26:28They had some boost in the last few days.

00:26:32I I do think next Here, as we move into this new

00:26:36thing, one of the one of the things I

00:26:39one of the things I need to do is

00:26:41Decide on some changes I want to make to kind of the format of the podcast.

00:26:47One of the things I would like to do, To be honest, and this is actually something that your listeners could help out with, I would love to get some value for valued music on here, at least clips of it.

00:26:59Because probably my clips that are on here have gotten stale,

McIntosh:00:27:04so to speak, and, you know, we're changing the name of the

McIntosh:00:27:08Podcast, it'd be a great time to do this. If you have any suggestions for

00:27:14some value for value music that's out there on Wave Lake or something like that.

00:27:20I will try and figure out at least how I can

00:27:24maybe initially just clip it in, and then Ultimately,

00:27:28there is a way now that people

00:27:31do,

00:27:34splits where, like,

00:27:36if

00:27:37well,

00:27:39splits have been around for a while, but specifically,

McIntosh:00:27:42Let's say I've got

McIntosh:00:27:44I'm just gonna say the Foo Fighters because they're the first thing that comes to mind. They're certainly not value for value, but let's say I've got one of the Foo Fighters songs at the start of the podcast.

00:27:54When you're listening to that either streaming or boosting that,

00:27:58Part of that would go directly to them, and then

00:28:01it would switch

00:28:03after the song

00:28:05to whatever the normal was if it was just me, if I was the only one,

00:28:09or me and a cohost or or whatever. Right?

00:28:13I'd again, it's

00:28:14it's like. I don't talk about the music stuff on here very often, but

00:28:19it definitely

00:28:21Seems to be gaining a a good amount of traction, actually. I have high hopes for it. I really think

00:28:29This may move forward the live

00:28:31podcasting stuff and make it a little more

00:28:34important, which would be really nice.

00:28:37So we'll see how that turns out, but that's one of the things I would like to do. If you have some suggestions for kind of Start end song type stuff. If there's a

00:28:48a 15 to 22nd

00:28:50clip, that would sound good. I'm not gonna have well, the end, I can do a whole song as I do now. I do a much longer thing now, but the start needs to be,

00:29:01a shorter amount, I do not have a mixer

00:29:05right now. If I had a mixer, we could, like, bring the sound down

00:29:09on the music,

00:29:11Make a bed. Let it play underneath

00:29:13while I'm talking over it at the start.

00:29:16But for now, we got kinda gotta keep out of that.

00:29:19So if you have some suggestions about that, feel free to

00:29:23boost those in and let me know or send me an email

00:29:27at mcintosh@gen-btc.com.

00:29:32Okay. I guess I'll I've only had one boost, and that's fine. I thought I had two.

00:29:37Apparently, I did not. From episode 146, I got

00:29:41a 3333

00:29:43boost,

00:29:44from Sir Michael,

00:29:46and he

00:29:47said,

00:29:49listening on fountain. Thank you, Sir Michael. I appreciate that. And he said,

00:29:55Happy Thanksgiving. Did you see the fees paid for block

00:29:5981808

00:30:02seven.

00:30:03No. I did not.

00:30:04Not directly.

00:30:06I have heard about this, and I must actually gonna talk about it in the news already, but I appreciate that.

00:30:12It's it's insane. So they this has actually happened a couple of times lately, and historically, this has happened

00:30:19a few times.

McIntosh:00:30:21So

00:30:22you can

00:30:23overpay

McIntosh:00:30:25to have your transaction included in the blockchain.

00:30:28So, literally, I could be sending someone

00:30:3210,000 sats,

00:30:34and I could have a dollar a a dollar.

00:30:39A Bitcoin be the transaction fee, which would just be

00:30:42stupid.

00:30:44It has happened.

00:30:46There have been cases where

00:30:49fees have been returned.

00:30:501 happened recently.

McIntosh:00:30:54I'm not,

00:30:56To be honest,

00:30:57as a miner,

00:30:58I don't really like that.

McIntosh:00:31:00Not really a fan.

00:31:02I get it why they do it, but

00:31:05Really, most of the time, these are bugs that need to be fixed.

00:31:09I hope that

00:31:10that that was the case here

00:31:13where there was a bug and,

00:31:15maybe they've figured that out, and hopefully, they're fixing that in their wallet.

00:31:21I'm gonna look that up real quick. 8 let's see.

McIntosh:00:31:26Block 818087.

McIntosh:00:31:31So

00:31:34yeah. I did. I definitely heard about this. If you look it up on a block explorer, you can go to Paul.space.

00:31:41This happened

00:31:43on 11/23,

00:31:44probably UTC time, but,

00:31:474 days ago,

McIntosh:00:31:49About 4 o'clock in the morning.

McIntosh:00:31:52And just to give you an idea, the median fee was a 141

00:31:55sets. The fee span went from a 129

00:31:59sats per v byte

00:32:01to, let's see, 16,000,000

00:32:05917,160

McIntosh:00:32:07sats per  byte.

00:32:10The total fees,

McIntosh:00:32:13I hope you're sitting down for this is 85.216

00:32:19Bitcoin,

00:32:20which right now or at least at the time this was,

00:32:23mined was worth $3,000,000,

00:32:27Almost $3,200,000.

McIntosh:00:32:29The total block

00:32:31was 91.466

00:32:34Bitcoin,

00:32:36and that was $3,400,000.

McIntosh:00:32:39It was mined in the amp pool.

00:32:42It is possible there was something going on that, you know, some exchange or whatever in the background, who knows,

00:32:51or This was simply a mistake. I haven't heard one way or the other.

00:32:57I don't know.

00:32:58I wonder what the subsidies were, not the subsidies. I wonder what the fees

00:33:03in Antpool were for that block when it got mined like.

00:33:08To understand

00:33:10The it's 91.466

00:33:12Bitcoin, but that's divided up among tens of thousands probably of minors.

00:33:18It's a much, much smaller amount per miner for that block.

00:33:22Very, very interesting

00:33:24kind of one of the little edge cases

00:33:27with Bitcoin.

00:33:28It seems like that only happened, like, a couple months ago or maybe even less. I mean, it's kinda weird

00:33:35because you don't hear about this for a long time and then just boom all of a sudden now it's happened,

00:33:42a couple of times. So let's see. 123.

00:33:45Wow. We mined 4 blocks today in brains. That is awesome.

00:33:49It's been tough.

00:33:511, 2, 3 the day before and then 1 the day before that. So that was the 24th and then not on the 23rd.

00:33:592 on the 22nd, and then 1, 2, 3 on the 21st, and then a 4 day gap

00:34:05Between 17th and 21st, that as far as I know is the longest I've seen brains go

00:34:11since I've been mining,

00:34:12early this year

00:34:14on brains,

00:34:16without a block.

00:34:17So that was depressing.

00:34:21Let's look Look at the 7 day moving

00:34:24average type thing here. See if it started to move up.

00:34:28A little bit.

00:34:30Yeah. We've got this chart, basically, a 7 day average of the rewards.

00:34:35Essentially, in a graphical form is representing kind of this average Because

00:34:40with so much

00:34:41between one day and the next, it's you need a way to kinda average that out. So,

00:34:47very good. It does look like it's looking a little better. Just to give you an idea for my last block that I mined, and this essentially is for all the miners that I have in service. You get one reward. It's 0.00172902

00:35:05Bitcoin. So

00:35:0911000th,

00:35:11almost

00:35:1212 thousandth

00:35:13of a Bitcoin.

00:35:15I think I'm doing that math right. Pretty sure I am. But over time, it does add up,

00:35:21of course, or we wouldn't be doing this.

00:35:25So,

00:35:26sir Michael, I believe I've never heard from you. I have heard of you from other shows, and I do appreciate you listening.

00:35:34Absolutely.

00:35:35And it was awesome to hear from you, so thank you very much.

00:35:40I believe yeah. I believe I've heard of you from other shows.

McIntosh:00:35:44You're definitely, I would assume, a night of the round table or a night of the,

McIntosh:00:35:49no agenda table or however they say it. Very cool.

00:35:53So aside from that little bit of news, which was Kind of an interesting little side note. I already mentioned

00:36:00mining difficulty. This was actually the 6th increase

00:36:06And going back 10 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 yeah. Going back 10 weeks.

00:36:11And so we are now at an all time high in mining difficulty.

00:36:17That's simply a reflection. Like I said, it's the number of minors. It's the number of hash. It's

00:36:22It's really all about that hash rate. What that means, we're at an all time high for

00:36:27our hash rate, which is absolutely

00:36:29What we see, we're pressing in towards 500

00:36:34Exashash.

00:36:35492 Exashash per second

00:36:38last,

00:36:38seven day average.

00:36:40Yep.

00:36:41fourteen day was 491.

00:36:43Thirty day was four seventy three. So as we go back in time on these averages, you can see the number lowers, which

00:36:51is exactly what you would expect given that

00:36:55We we see more and more hash rate coming online.

00:36:58So right now,

00:37:00the next difficulty adjustment, which isn't supposed to take place until December 9th, If it were to happen right now, it would be 1.06%

00:37:09down. So

00:37:11I don't know. Maybe we've reached some sort of top

00:37:15for now. I don't know where we can go with this because

00:37:19It's getting difficult enough even with the hash price that I think if things continue the way that they have been, we're going to start to see miners,

00:37:28Public miners experiencing

00:37:31extreme distress and

00:37:33certainly in terms of their

00:37:34finances.

00:37:36We will see. I know that sounds crazy

00:37:40with $37,000

00:37:41Bitcoin,

00:37:43but

00:37:45It's not. It

00:37:47might be really tough around the happening next year. We will see. Alright.

00:37:52Other news. Other news. Other news.

00:37:55.

00:37:57I thought this was very interesting. So BlackRock,

00:38:00of course, largest,

00:38:02basically, largest investment

00:38:05firm in the

00:38:07world,

00:38:09who He's filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF.

00:38:13Back in 2022,

00:38:14apparently, they released a study

00:38:17that indicated

00:38:19That the optimal portfolio allocation to Bitcoin was

00:38:2484.9%.

00:38:26The remaining 15.1%

00:38:28can go to equities and bonds. I would not have believed it if I didn't see the document myself. It's right here. I've reposted it. And that is literally

00:38:38what it says.

00:38:40I've

00:38:41they're very bullish on Bitcoin, if that's true. We'll see.

00:38:46If you entered at the all time high, like I said, you'd be up 40%

00:38:51even though we're still 40 plus percent off That all time high. That is the power

00:38:58the power of DCA.

00:38:59Do not underestimate that.

00:39:02This is all getting posted on Twitter, by the way. You can follow me at McintoshFintech

00:39:07there.

00:39:08One very important thing I wanted to note.

00:39:11It's probably the biggest news of the week, and I hope it doesn't go unnoticed.

00:39:16There's a company,

00:39:18up in Canada

00:39:20run by a a guy with a,

00:39:23anonymous handle of u t x o underscore one,

00:39:26o n e,

00:39:28called nodeless.

00:39:29Io. It looks I've never run it. It looks like and I've never used it. So it's open source.

00:39:35So you can run your own, or you can use his setup or her setup. It's basically a way to make it very easy to take money,

00:39:43Satoshis

00:39:44online

00:39:45for businesses.

00:39:46It's a really interesting looking

00:39:50piece of software. Well, he lives in Canada, and apparently, they have decided

00:39:54They are going to investigate him and so on and so forth. So he got some type of notice. I don't know exactly.

00:40:02He did say in his,

00:40:04notice. He said, I am being investigated

00:40:07for running an illegal money transmission business

00:40:11in Canada.

00:40:12And

00:40:15by the advice of his lawyers, he needs to shut down the main instance Sense of node list. So effectively, he's closing node list down.

00:40:22The code is open source. It is still available. I would highly encourage

00:40:26anyone

00:40:28who has interest in this to pursue this,

00:40:31posting it elsewhere.

00:40:33I think this is very valuable software.

00:40:36I actually disagree that it's money transmission

00:40:39business.

00:40:40The reason why is because he's their argument Would be well, he's making a percentage

00:40:47off of what you know, if you have, say

00:40:51Well, it's a percentage like whatever it is, and it's not very much. It's like 1% plus a 100 sats. So if I send a 1,000 sats,

00:41:00I mean, a 1,000 sats isn't very much, so it'd be a 100 sats of that. So 10% plus 1% of a 1,000.

00:41:07But if it's

McIntosh:00:41:0910,000

00:41:10sats. It would still only be

McIntosh:00:41:13a 100 sats plus 1% of 10,000, whatever that is. So,

00:41:19pretty reasonable,

00:41:21and that's why they're saying he's running a money transmission business. But,

00:41:25Look. This stuff has to be updated. This is the new world and, you know, I don't know.

00:41:31But I was very disappointed to see that. I Ask him if he would come on the show. I've not gotten a response. I'm sure he's inundated,

McIntosh:00:41:40with stuff,

00:41:42and I get that. But, Yeah. It'd be cool to have him on the show.

McIntosh:00:41:46I posted a chart from somebody else, but I posted a chart about

00:41:52the national income earned by the bottom

00:41:5550%. So in other words, the

00:41:57The lower half of the country, their share of the national income

00:42:02has been basically going straight downhill

00:42:05since the

00:42:0619 eighties, since early

00:42:08eighties.

00:42:10And,

00:42:11it's sad. It went from 20%

00:42:14down to,

00:42:1612%.

00:42:17And

00:42:20this is I I think you could argue that this is

00:42:24representative of a number of things, but, I mean, our economy is just in trouble. And this is the world in general. The rich are getting I mean, You've heard the statement. The rich get richer, the poor get poor,

00:42:36and

00:42:37that's true. The rich are getting richer because they have money and assets that

00:42:43appreciate

00:42:44with interest real estate,

00:42:47not with interest, with inflation.

00:42:50As inflation goes up, house prices go up, you're making more money if you own the house and you rent it out. It's that simple.

00:42:58If I'm living paycheck to paycheck and I don't have enough money to invest in a 401 k

00:43:05or real estate or anything like that.

00:43:09I don't get any advantage from that, and I only get the disadvantages

McIntosh:00:43:15of inflation.
