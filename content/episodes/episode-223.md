McIntosh interviews SeedSigner from the open-source SeedSigner project, discussing the volunteer-driven Bitcoin signing device that uses general-purpose hardware and stateless operation for enhanced supply chain security. The conversation covers recent developments including multi-language support and the new SeedSigner Plus with a larger display, improved ergonomics, and USB-C connectivity. SeedSigner explains the project's multisig-first philosophy and how the device's design allows users to take more responsibility for their Bitcoin security while avoiding the trust requirements of commercial hardware wallets.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “Horizons of Hope” by Jawbone.
