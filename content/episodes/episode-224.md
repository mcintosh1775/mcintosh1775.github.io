McIntosh and Kenshin discuss the renewed controversy around Bitcoin Core's plan to remove OP_return limits in version 30, which would allow unlimited data uploads to the blockchain. The hosts strongly oppose this change, arguing it enables spam and goes against Bitcoin's purpose as peer-to-peer electronic cash. They advocate for Bitcoin Knots as an alternative, which now represents 18% of public nodes and maintains stricter filtering.

The episode also covers McIntosh's transition from Mac to Ubuntu Studio for production, a passionate take on generational wealth complaints (arguing younger people have Bitcoin as an escape route from the broken fiat system), and September's historically poor Bitcoin performance - though potential Fed rate cuts could change that pattern. Current Bitcoin price: $111,970 (up 95% year-over-year), with gold hitting new highs.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “Horizons of Hope” by Jawbone.
