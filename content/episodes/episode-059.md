Monero is blockchain and token dedicated to privacy. While I would not recommend it as an investment, it may have utility as a way to transact with other people while providing privacy in a digital universe. In this episode I provide a brief overview of Monero, where it might fit into your digital assets and even cover a bit of how to mine for this privacy focused coin.
