The Hive blockchain has been around for quite a while and I have never discussed it on the GWC podcast. It's not a chain that I know a lot about, but what I do know is intriguing. Recently I contacted Brian of London about coming on the show and he was gracious enough to do so. We had a great conversation about [Hive](https://hive.io/) in general and his work developing [Podping](https://podping.org/) and the [V4V](https://v4v.app/) app.
