In this week's episode I cover a few different things. Times right now are trying. Both the stock market and crypto in general seem to be in an outright free fall. Next week the Fed will most likely be announcing another half a percent interest rate increase. The majority of investors still consider crypto to be a risk-on asset so there is no significant decoupling of btc and other crypto from traditional stocks. Where do you go from here?
