McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, sat stackers. Today is November 2nd, and this is episode 141 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, Macintosh, and today's episode is a conversation

00:00:10with

00:00:12Seth

00:00:14for

00:00:16privacy.

00:00:42Alright. Let's,

00:00:43let's do our price update.

00:00:46To our market update, and we will jump right on in.

00:00:50We've got lots to talk about today. We had a great conversation with Seth, and I wanna get right into that.

00:00:57Right now, as I record, the price of Bitcoin is 34,620

00:01:03three. That's

00:01:0634,623.

00:01:09And our block height

00:01:11at time of recording

00:01:13is

00:01:15814-784.

00:01:19I'm sorry?

00:01:21That's 814-874.

00:01:24TikTok next block.

00:01:26Alright.

00:01:28As I started recording earlier today,

00:01:33an hour ago or so, an hour and a half ago with

00:01:37Right as I sat down to record, I got

00:01:40a new block.

00:01:411st one in over a day. Been a little slow

00:01:45and a little slow there for the old brains pool,

00:01:49but that's the way it goes.

00:01:52So,

00:01:53Anyways,

00:01:55our difficulty adjustment

00:01:57at this point

00:01:58will be,

00:02:01looking like it's going to happen.

00:02:04Oh my. Where is that? I can always lose track of this thing. There it is. November 11th

00:02:102023.

00:02:12Of course.

00:02:13Right now, it's estimated to be 8.41%

00:02:16up. Man, I hope it is not.

00:02:19Our average block time right now, though, is 9 minutes and 14 seconds, which is why we would have that difficulty adjustment up.

00:02:26The pool is full,

00:02:29and

00:02:30sets are, blocks are expensive.

00:02:34Transactions,

00:02:34I should say,

00:02:36more expensive.

00:02:37Our hash rate right now, according to this 7 day moving average, 467.9

00:02:44x hash.

00:02:46Yikes.

00:02:47Keep on climbing towards 500.

00:02:50Man, could you guys slow down? And we are officially at 88%

00:02:54of our progress

00:02:56to the next having.

00:02:58How are things doing out in the market? Well, I told you the price.

00:03:03As of this recording. The price is good.

00:03:07We have not broken

00:03:1035,000

00:03:11at least significantly at this point. We have definitely been staying below it,

00:03:17and

00:03:18we're just kinda where we're at. I mean,

00:03:22Let's look at the chart here real quick. I don't think a whole lot has changed.

00:03:28I guess I was wrong about that bull pin.

00:03:31So it turns out I told you last time we recorded, we fell out of a bullpennant, which is true. You could certainly make the argument there was one there.

00:03:39But it

00:03:41It turns out that pendant is actually still forming.

00:03:46Very interesting.

00:03:50I would argue,

00:03:52we are getting towards the top of that. I do apologize.

00:03:56At the time, it made sense what I drew. I I really didn't wait long enough. It'd only been 3 days it'd been developing,

00:04:03so that's kind of my fault.

00:04:06But

00:04:07regardless,

00:04:08we've still got that $35,000

00:04:12and some change,

00:04:14kind of sealing.

00:04:15We've not broken through that, but it will not it has not fallen down.

00:04:20The Bollinger Bands are wide open. We could go way up. We could hit that 37,000

00:04:27before we if, like, if it just woke up today and said, we're going,

00:04:32and not even go outside the ball of your bands. That would be pretty sweet.

00:04:37It looks like though before the end of the week, there's a very good chance,

00:04:41we could break through. I think by next Sunday, we'll know one way or the other. More likely we're going up, but certainly one way or the other. Of course, as always, this is not marketing

00:04:51marketing. This is not trading advice.

00:04:54As always here on Generation Bitcoin.

00:04:57We

00:04:58dollar cost average. We do not

00:05:02try and time this market.

00:05:03I hope you are stacking sets.

00:05:06However you are doing that, of course, I talk about strike a lot. I would

00:05:10especially given today's topic

00:05:13mentioned,

00:05:14of course, your KYC ing yourself using that, but,

00:05:18but it's certainly a handy way to do that.

00:05:21Privacy is something here on generation Bitcoin that I think we're going to end up talking about more and more over the coming months

00:05:28and probably years.

00:05:31It's just too important a topic. It's something that a lot of people don't understand.

00:05:36And talking to Seth today gave us a great intro to some of the concepts. I've discussed a lot of this in the past.

00:05:43I wanted to have him on specifically to talk about this fence and regulation, which we did.

00:05:49But,

00:05:50He is a great resource for this kind of stuff, and we're talking about all the different places that he can be reached,

00:05:57read,

00:05:58absorbed, listened to,

00:06:00and so on. So we'll be jumping right into that in just a second. But, again, in general market,

00:06:06we're We're about ready to make a move. I'm gonna go ahead and say by Sunday,

00:06:11by the end of the day, Sunday,

00:06:14I'm thinking by the close of the week,

00:06:17it's gonna do something.

00:06:18So

00:06:21alright. So we're gonna go from here. We're gonna jump right into this interview. Again, it was a great interview.

00:06:27I really appreciate this. At the end, I'm gonna wrap up some things, maybe spanned a little bit on one of the topics that we were talking about. I don't feel like

00:06:37we discussed it enough. It's actually a new

00:06:40new thing for him, and I kinda wanted to pull that out

00:06:45and make sure you are aware of it. So enjoy this, and here we go.

00:06:50For our main section today, we're gonna be talking with Seth for privacy for we're gonna be talking to Seth. That's his handle on Twitter, Seth for privacy,

00:06:59about some privacy topics, about fencing,

00:07:03the regulation that they're attempting to pass right now that, in my opinion,

00:07:08is not a real good thing. I think he shares that thing, that idea. And then we're also gonna be talking about his other pursuits because he has a number of them.

00:07:19He looks to me like he's a really busy person. We'll find out.

00:07:24But,

00:07:25Yeah. Let's Seth, first of all, welcome to the show. Thanks for, thanks for being here.

Seth:00:07:30Thanks so much for having me, man. I'm I'm very excited to to chat through these topics, and I don't know. There's there's so many things kind of pressing in the world today that I'm trying to do what I can to help with. But a lot of that comes down to Kind of the the end user taking action.

00:07:44So looking forward to talking through this. I know a lot of this stuff can sound kinda depressing at at first glance, but I think there's some some good optimistic takes and some good action items we can we can take out of it. So looking forward to it. Great. I,

McIntosh:00:07:57I'm glad you've got some optimism.

00:07:59Maybe you could have a little bit for me. That'd be probably a good thing.

00:08:05Yeah. It's hard sometimes when you're looking at this this kind of stuff. It it can be, you know, frankly, depressing,

00:08:12because

00:08:13we we see these things changing, and and, you know, for those of us who've been around frankly since before, the Patriot Act, which was, done by,

00:08:23911.

00:08:24What it was initiated out of that, really. Mhmm. A lot of the privacy issues that we're having today. And I think I've seen you mention this that

00:08:33that they stem from that, in my opinion. So

00:08:36wow. Anyways,

00:08:37let's not get into all that quite yet. You've got a lot of other things going on, and I wanna talk about about those first. So first of all, you are a podcaster, so let's talk about that.

Seth:00:08:48Yeah. So I kind of have a a broad range of things that I do or have done in the space.

00:08:53So generally, I've I've had a good platform on on Twitter,

00:08:57now X, which I don't know if I ever get used to there being a new name.

00:09:02Focusing on essentially

00:09:03privacy

00:09:04and

00:09:05security

00:09:06education has been kind of my focus. I really got woken up to the need for personal privacy after reading reading Snowden's book,

00:09:14really about 2019, so relatively

00:09:16relatively new to the scene. And that that made me take a kind of a drastic shift in what I wanted to work on with my career, what I wanted to work on in my free time. And

00:09:25Out of that came me using Twitter as an educational tool, and then eventually launching my own podcast, which was called Opt Out. It is still

00:09:32up. I run the website and everything. I haven't recorded in a while just because

00:09:36work life and family life have taken over the the majority of the time I was using for that before. But,

00:09:42It's, I think, a a good resource, especially when starting the personal privacy journey there. But that's that's like a very quick background. We can get into kind of the work side of things and and where I've landed there if you want as well.

McIntosh:00:09:54Feel free to share as much as you want. I mean, your name is Seth for privacy,

00:09:59so

00:09:59I don't talk a whole lot about kind of my background in general. I'm a software engineer, but that's basically the extent of what I've told my audience.

00:10:07You're you're you're welcome to share whatever you wish.

00:10:11You do have some other things going on that you talk about on Twitter that we do certainly need to get into.

00:10:18So

Seth:00:10:19Yeah. Yeah. I can also expand the intro a little bit. So I I am Seth from privacy, but I I do show my face on on podcast video and that sort of thing because

00:10:29I do think that there's a a value in someone who deeply loves personal privacy and understands it, like, I think well and is able to to distill the topics down still being an approachable face, not just a pseudonym.

00:10:41I think that the the default approach for most people should be Pseudonymous or anonymous. It's just safer. It's it's better for for almost every aspect of life online, I mean, obviously. Like, the real world buying a house, etcetera. It's Not easy to do anonymously, unfortunately.

00:10:56But I've chosen to be a little bit more publicly facing. So for my work, in in my past, I've worked in IT. I won't go more detail than that. It's not not very interesting.

00:11:06But the the place that I've landed is I actually started working in the Bitcoin space,

00:11:11just over a year ago now. Okay. I jumped in and joined the team at Foundation Devices,

00:11:16who build Passport, which is a Bitcoin only hardware wallets. Very easy to use, very approachable, very security and privacy conscious,

00:11:23and then a mobile app called Envoy. So I jumped in with them initially as head of content. It's kind of expanded to to head of Strategy and marketing. But,

00:11:30really, the goal is bringing FreedomTech, which

00:11:34very simply FreedomTech as a as a category. It's just technology that empowers you, the user,

00:11:39Bringing that kind of technology to the masses, making it approachable,

00:11:43accessible, beautiful.

00:11:44Trying to kinda kinda bring a lot of what Apple has done, but do it with an open source ethos and no walled gardens and and all the other fun stuff that comes with a lot of the the Bitcoin ethos.

McIntosh:00:11:54Very cool. So I have not used the Foundation,

00:11:58product,

00:11:59at this point. So I can't really speak about it, but saying things like it's Bitcoin only,

00:12:04that's obviously a very good thing.

00:12:07Did you are are you saying that it's open source as well, the code for it?

Seth:00:12:12Yeah. Yeah. So we actually open source is at the core of everything we do. So we're, we're big about contributing back to any projects that we use open source code from. Okay. Contributing to industry standards. But when it comes to our products that comes down to being open source hardware and software.

00:12:27Cool. So there are some good projects in the space that are open source software, which is vital, and we're thankful for that. I mean, We we view any project that's open source, even if it's a competitor, as being a positive and an add to the space.

00:12:40But We focus on doing both open source hardware and software, both to minimize trust in us, so that there's there's nothing happening behind the scenes that that no one who understands the code or understands the schematics can't can't uncover and point out to to people to to warn them if we were trying to do something sketchy, But also so that, no matter what happens to the company,

00:13:00everything that we make will always be contributing back to the the the broader Bitcoin and FreedomTech ecosystem. So even if Foundation goes away. Everything that we've made will help to create better products for Bitcoin and further technologies, as we expand

00:13:14down the line. So it's it's a big thing for us that what we do doesn't just contribute to

00:13:19a regulatory moat or to to our income, but it it it contributes also to the broader ecosystem and and helps the the space as a whole. So that's why we focus on being open source hardware and software with with everything we built.

McIntosh:00:13:32Very cool.

00:13:33I did wanna mention, and you can correct me if I'm saying this

00:13:37improperly. I think I'm saying it at least close to correct.

00:13:41One of the definitions

00:13:43to go back, you talking about people being pseudo anonymous on the Internet and this kind of thing.

00:13:50Privacy is the ability to selectively reveal what you want people to know about yourself. Does that is have you heard that? Yeah. Okay. That's a it's a fantastic definition. It's usually my go to when I start to kinda describe personal privacy to someone. Right. And you choose

00:14:06to tell you put yourself on video, and I personally wouldn't have a problem with that either. I've never done video,

00:14:13a podcast, or anything like that at this point, but I don't have a problem with that. But you have somebody like,

00:14:19dear Gigi, and I hope I didn't butcher his name, but, you know, he literally does not show his face. And and that's his choice. He is choosing to not reveal that for whatever it doesn't even matter, whatever those reasons are. That's his choice. So I just I wanted to go back and kinda put a a bow tie on that and emphasize that

00:14:40for the listeners. It's something that I've mentioned in the past,

00:14:44and you reminded me of that when when you were talking about that earlier.

Seth:00:14:49Yeah. I I definitely, I love that you expanded that and to expand it a little further, because I also mentioned pseudonymity and anonymity.

00:14:56It's privacy is not either of those things. So you can be passionate about personal privacy and not be anonymous or even pseudonymous. I could be using my my full name, telling every everybody where I work, and just choosing to To preserve the privacy of specific details about my life.

00:15:12But I could also love personal privacy, take active steps towards it, and be seeking to be totally anonymous.

00:15:19They're not things that have to go one way or another. Anonymity is very different than privacy. And like you said, privacy is just choosing what you reveal, and you can choose to reveal as little as possible, which would generally be closer towards anonymity Mhmm. Or as much as you want, which could be just totally being out in the public figure. But even even then, you still Both have a choice for privacy or should have a choice for privacy,

00:15:41or not. It's it's really up to you, which is the, I think, the important distinction there. And

McIntosh:00:15:47not to get too crazy or conspiracy theory here, but I feel like,

00:15:52I don't feel like. I believe that this is something that is being

00:15:57trampled in the financial realm

00:15:59constantly over the last 20 years or so.

00:16:03We see a push

00:16:05for central bank digital currencies, for example. And

00:16:09I believe in large part that's because they want to be able to track every purchase that you've got, and people don't realize

00:16:18How much data can be gathered from that if they're not

00:16:22involved in even certain parts of the industry, which I've not been directly involved in

00:16:27advertising or this kind of thing, but

00:16:30I do understand how it works. I mean, they can piece together

00:16:33so much data and analyze it about Somebody, they can tell your your patterns and and all of this kind of stuff.

00:16:40And if you're using a digital currency,

00:16:42You have no ability of a nonprivate digital currency. Let me say that.

00:16:48That you have no ability to stop that. All of that data gets hoovered up. It gets pulled in to a database, and then it can be analyzed and, you know,

00:16:58sliced and diced and whatever later. So,

00:17:02anyways, the point to all that is when we push back on things like Bitcoin and say, no. We need privacy

00:17:09for for Bitcoin.

00:17:11We

00:17:12it's kind of the same argument about cash. I don't care

00:17:16who does what with cash.

00:17:18People do bad things with money regardless. Everybody's always like, Oh, well, the drug dealers use cash or the drug dealers use Bitcoin.

00:17:26I don't I don't care.

00:17:29That's not you

00:17:31You can't stop everybody from using something because of what somebody does with it.

00:17:36And,

00:17:37you know, I don't know. I'm just maybe I'm getting off on a rant here. No. But it does tie into what we're fixing to talk about with FinCym.

00:17:46Yeah. So Yeah.

Seth:00:17:49Go ahead, sir. I was just gonna just gonna say, like, I I think that's something a lot of people don't understand is that financial privacy isn't just like a small piece of the pie. It's not like you have your your digital privacy, your email privacy, your mobile phone privacy, your messaging privacy, and your financial privacy, and they're all equal. It's not really how it is. No. Because if if you you touched on it with CBDCs, but if someone has visibility into every single

00:18:13Minute detail of how you spend your money and where you receive money from. Mhmm. They know everything about you, basically. Right. They may not have explicit details,

00:18:23But they're gonna know who you meet with, where you eat, who you ate, who you drink coffee with that day Mhmm. Where you work, who you did a little work on the side for they're gonna know everything about you. So if you don't have financial privacy,

00:18:35basically, all of the other human rights that that you would otherwise have falls apart very quickly. It's it's It's really the core to me of of any kind of privacy.

McIntosh:00:18:44I get so frustrated

00:18:46when I go into the bank,

00:18:49and I need to send somebody some money and it's above a certain amount, which I believe in the United States at this point is is somewhere around $10,000.

00:18:59And they're like, well, what what are you doing

00:19:02with this? Why are you sending this person money? And I I

00:19:05Honestly, I want to scream in their faces. None of your blankety blank, blank, blank, blank business.

00:19:14But you can't.

00:19:15Right? I mean, I can choose to take my money out of the bank and

00:19:19literally carry it to whoever it is that needs it, but

00:19:24you're trapped in that system

Seth:00:19:26at least to that extent. You know? But Even if you did that, there would be a a nice report filed about you. Right. You withdrew all your money from the bank and did something with it that they couldn't track. You almost can't win at this system. And the thing is is They are assuming that you're trying to launder Monday.

McIntosh:00:19:44They are presuming

00:19:46that you're guilty. And I look at I'm not a constitutional

00:19:49scholar,

00:19:50but one of the amendments is

00:19:53you can't you don't assume guilt.

00:19:56Mhmm. Right?

00:19:58And people have privacy. That's another one. So,

Seth:00:20:02I mean, I I don't know. I don't wanna get off well, I mean, that's kind of the topic in the podcast. But Yeah. Yeah. But It connects directly. I mean, if you if you talk about this concept of guilty until proven innocent, the the Finsen

00:20:17Proposal that's come out

00:20:18perfectly aligns with that shift in how governments view their citizens' finances, which is that anything that doesn't meet this explicit and insane criteria.

00:20:28Right. Anything that doesn't meet those criteria are, for some reason, money laundering and evil. Right. And there's this presumption that you must be a money launderer unless to prove that you're not to us Right. Which completely flips the entire, at least, US judicial system onset.

McIntosh:00:20:41So for those who haven't heard. Can you go over kind of what we're talking about here with Vinson? So they came out with a

00:20:50proposed regulation, and I would say it's proposed.

00:20:53That has not been implemented,

00:20:55but, kinda take it from there and cover what the regulation is about,

00:21:00how people,

00:21:01Well, we'll go from there. Just

Seth:00:21:03Yeah. Yeah. I can definitely dive into it. So there's a there's a long blog post that I've written that will go probably more detailed than we'll go into today Okay. That, I I can send you, and you can link in share notes. Absolutely.

00:21:15The The crux of it is that the US government has shown that they want to prevent

00:21:21people from being able to use privacy tools when it comes to cryptocurrency.

00:21:25And this has been a it's been a long war that they've been waging Mhmm. Really over a decade now. They've been attacking privacy projects within the Bitcoin space, it's been rapidly ramping up in the last 2 years, really starting with the sanctions against Tornado Cash, which we don't have to get into in too much detail. But Very quickly, Tornado Cash is a decentralized privacy tool for Ethereum,

00:21:45that could provide strong privacy.

00:21:47A small part of its usage was,

00:21:50hackers supposedly from North Korea who stole funds within the Ethereum ecosystem

00:21:54and then use Tornado Cash to gain privacy.

00:21:57Fast forward, US government, they sanctioned the entirety of the Tornado Cash project, including their GitHub repos.

00:22:03One of the founders is arrested in the Netherlands.

00:22:06And then a year later, they ramped that up even more. In August this year, they indicted the other two remaining founders of Tornado Cash on charges of money laundering and money transmission,

00:22:17and are seeking, I think, 45 years in prison for the two of them even though they had no technical ability to prevent illicit usage of their tool. Right. So I have another blog post on that if you wanna get into kind of the the history there. But

00:22:30I think the context is helpful because for a lot of people, they saw this Fincen proposal, and they just thought it came out of left field. Like, where did this come from? Mhmm. This seems very, very detached from what we thought the US government wanted. But it's actually just a the next step in the the war that they've been waging against privacy tools for a while.

00:22:49But very briefly, essentially, what happened is FinCen

00:22:53had already had a proposal in place.

00:22:56It was very clear that this was written up before the conflict, in the Middle East happened. But they used this conflict in the Middle East to to be kind of the boogeyman for this proposal.

00:23:06And the the justification

00:23:07is essentially

00:23:09we need people who use privacy tools to be on a list because

00:23:13Terrorists use cryptocurrency for financing,

00:23:16their terrorism.

McIntosh:00:23:17Mhmm.

Seth:00:23:19Interestingly, they don't provide any specifics on How much cryptocurrency is used for terrorism, and there's been a a massive backlash over the past couple of weeks because the the main

00:23:29article that was used for this, that was used by senator Warren in in her comments

00:23:34was essentially totally false And 99% over attributed Correct. Cryptocurrency usage to terrorists.

00:23:41Mhmm. But all that aside, essentially, Fincen has said, because terrorists use cryptocurrency

00:23:45supposedly,

00:23:47we need to make sure that whenever people use privacy tools within the cryptocurrency space,

00:23:52anytime they interact with a a regulated entity, be it a bank, a cryptocurrency exchange,

00:23:58cryptocurrency service provider.

00:24:00Basically, anything that falls under US regulations.

00:24:03That need to have their information, all of it, including who they are,

00:24:08info about their their passport, Social Security number, whatever info you on file through the normal connect KYC procedures,

00:24:14and then send all of that info immediately along with info on where their funds came from, what privacy tool they used,

00:24:22amongst lots of other details. Package that up nicely and send it off to Finson immediately. Mhmm. So this is a big shift where even though Exchanges were using what was called KYC know your customer before where you'd have to, you know, submit a selfie and a a nice little video of you dancing with your passport or whatever to to get onto an exchange. That information wasn't sent to the government immediately. Right. Obviously, a lot of it ends up with the government, and the government can request it anytime.

00:24:47But with this new fence in ruling, whenever you use a privacy tool, all that information about you along with all of your history about what you've done in the exchange and any knowledge of on chain activity,

00:24:57Including privacy tool usage. It's immediately sent to the government, and you end up on a nice tidy list

McIntosh:00:25:02that apparently also happens to have terrorists and money launderers. Sure. Of course, because you're evil, and you used a money laundering service

00:25:11called a coin join.

Seth:00:25:14Uh-huh.

McIntosh:00:25:15So are they targeting

00:25:17a specific

00:25:18set of

00:25:20techno

00:25:20services like,

00:25:22I don't know. I'm trying to think. Samurai Whirlpool maybe,

00:25:26or are they targeting

00:25:28a technology

00:25:29like CoinJoin in general?

Seth:00:25:31Does that make sense? Yeah. No. That definitely makes sense. So the the target of the legislation, basically, how they define what they call a mixer, which I'll just called privacy tools because even the term mixing isn't as broad as their definition implies.

00:25:45Mhmm. Essentially, they're saying that

00:25:49Anything

00:25:50that

00:25:51provides

00:25:52privacy,

00:25:53no matter what,

00:25:54counts as a

00:25:56Cryptocurrency privacy tool, and that should be subject to these regulations.

00:26:00Specifically, they say,

00:26:02anything that facilitates transactions that obfuscate the source, destination, or amount Mhmm. Regardless of the type of protocol or service used. So they they do explicitly talk about some things.

00:26:14One of the specific categories they have sounds exactly like CoinJoin protocols, the Mhmm. The kind of broad protocol, not a specific one. Right. They don't name Wasabi or Samurai.

00:26:24They do name tornado cash because, obviously, the US government already has open legal action against TornadoCash. Mhmm. So they use that as as a precedent

00:26:32for bad people using,

00:26:34these services and thus because TornadoCash is bad, Every privacy tool is bad.

00:26:39So that's their their broad definition. But it's it's hilarious because they even

00:26:44Know that their definition is overly broad. If you look further in kind of how they want to define this, they say, Fincen acknowledges this definition is relatively broad. However, given the nature of mixing, Fincen deems the breadth of this definition to be necessary. Wow. They're encompassing

00:26:59every single tool that I can think of. And I would include the centralized mixers that we've had in the past in Bitcoin, things like Helix. There's a lot of other examples of those.

00:27:09Centralized coin join tools like Wasabi Wallet or Samura wallet.

00:27:13Decentralized tools like join mic join market or pay join seem like they would fit under this. Any kind of centralized instant exchanger, like fixed float or anything like that.

00:27:23Obviously, TornadoCash, they supposedly mention it. I would see decentralized privacy coins like Monero fitting under this definition and even decentralized exchanges because they they specifically talk about anytime you swap between cryptocurrencies

00:27:36that counts as a mixer,

00:27:38even though that makes no sense at all. That's it. Yeah. They include that as well because why not just lump up lump in everything?

McIntosh:00:27:44So this clearly is not a good bill or it's not a bill. This clearly clearly is not a good regulation.

00:27:51Mhmm.

00:27:52As an end user,

00:27:54how can we push back against this?

Seth:00:27:58Yeah.

00:27:59Yeah. And that's

00:28:01It's a tricky one. So if you are a US citizen, you can take the time to submit a comment

00:28:06and explain

00:28:07why you view the proposal as

00:28:10Illegitimate. Okay.

00:28:12And the the caveat there is obviously there's no

00:28:16explicit

00:28:18Control. We don't we don't get to vote on it or anything like that. We didn't get to elect the people that are part of Fincen in. Like, we we have no direct control

00:28:26as US citizens.

00:28:27But,

00:28:28supposedly, the comments are supposed to be considered and whether or not this will be,

00:28:33moved forward.

00:28:34And there's there's good efforts by people like Coin Center and and others who are helping to to set up this this comment system and helping people to better understand

00:28:43What these comments should look like when you submit them. It's something that I need to build out too for for our website freedom.tech

00:28:49to make it easier for people to submit comments.

00:28:51That's the I mean, that's really the only direct action you can take.

00:28:56But the I think there's some other very important pieces

00:29:00of of action that we each can take as well. I mean, one of them, even if we we do comment or don't comment, whatever, one of the things that we can do Very important is just raise social awareness around what's going on here. I mean, the the best thing for the government is that no one talks about this FinCEN proposal. Right. It just gets to pass in the shadows,

00:29:17And life moves on

00:29:19theoretically even though regulations continue to tighten around anyone who wants to retain any sort of financial privacy. Right. So we can really kind of, like, pull back the fog of war, pull back those shadows from from the people around us by just talking about it. Obviously, we each have different kind of spheres of influence. Mhmm. Different circles that we can talk about this and and make sure that people understand

00:29:40What's actually happening here, especially outside of the cryptocurrency space.

00:29:45Because like it or not, cryptocurrency users who would be deeply concerned about is a relatively small part of

00:29:51the world and and the the US populace.

00:29:54But if we can get a a broad consensus that we deserve financial privacy from our governments

00:30:00that can help to push back on this and and make it harder for

00:30:04the US government and specifically FinCEN to get something like this through because they they do still need our approval. They do still need our

00:30:11consent in one way or another. And if the masses are against something that they're proposing, they're they're much less Likely to try to force it through. Would this be something that say that either

McIntosh:00:30:21the house or the senate could come back and say you can't do this?

00:30:26Does that does that make sense?

Seth:00:30:28Yeah. I to be quite honest, I don't know what the next steps for this proposal are after it's approved or not by

00:30:38yeah. I I do need to do some more research on that, so I don't have an an interesting comment on the the next Steps here. I know that it waits for a 90 day proposal period,

00:30:46and then it moves on to be voted on, I believe, by the senate. Mhmm. But I I honestly don't know if I got my head, so I'll have to dig into that a little bit more. We'll we'll figure that out and and let the listeners know. Yeah. But it it's either that or there's gonna have to be court action

McIntosh:00:31:03at some point saying, you know, This is illegal. You're violating our privacy or or whatever the tact is.

00:31:12Wow. That's yeah.

00:31:13One of the interesting things that I see out of all of this is

00:31:18I I told my listeners

00:31:20either late last year or very early this year, like January 1,

00:31:25that I thought that 2023

00:31:27was gonna be a year of regulation. And I've been correct about that. Maybe not in really the way that I saw it

00:31:35in my head back then, but it's certainly been a lot of regulation.

00:31:40The SEC

00:31:42seems to be really cracking down on essentially

00:31:45alt coins.

00:31:47Okay. Casino coins. I like that term better than another term that gets batted around a lot. Yeah.

00:31:52Okay.

00:31:54Which is fine with me,

00:31:56because I believe what they're saying is legitimate, and I have looked at it. I'm not just spouting off what I've heard on Twitter.

00:32:04They

00:32:05they do fit the definition

00:32:07of securities and therefore they should be regulated.

00:32:10And when they whine about it, it just whatever.

00:32:13So

00:32:15they've looked at Bitcoin on the other hand, and the chairman has said this is a commodity. This is not a security. And

00:32:24In my thinking, well, it doesn't even fall under the SEC's purview at that point.

00:32:28But on the other hand, you've got this

00:32:31people like senator Warren primarily, although there are others who are just

00:32:36hell bent on

00:32:38killing

00:32:39everything. I don't I I mean, I don't even understand where it's coming from.

00:32:45She literally has people who are

00:32:47at least as, quote, progressive as she is, who are at this point saying, your narrative is all wrong.

00:32:55Bitcoin's not bad for the environment,

00:32:57you know, all of this kind of stuff, but she continues I mean, she was essentially behind this. Am I correct?

00:33:05Or a strong proponent of it.

Seth:00:33:07Yeah. A strong proponent for it and someone who's was pushing at the same time for anti crypto

McIntosh:00:33:15Legislation. Right.

Seth:00:33:16She made the same kind of claims around Hamas being heavily funded by cryptocurrencies

00:33:21even though that was absolutely disproven over the last week or 10 days.

00:33:26And so she has been a she's been a longtime

00:33:29hater of the things that Bitcoin.

00:33:32I mean, she she broadly it's cryptocurrency. It's not targeted towards Bitcoin, it seems. But Bitcoin is,

00:33:38along with maybe a couple others, are the the ones that are actual useful tools for freedom. Mhmm.

00:33:44I mean, the the the very transparent truth is It seems that the US government

00:33:49wants to have control over our finances. Right.

00:33:53Both surveillance control and actual

00:33:56Control and the ability to actually prevent us from doing things that we want with their finances. And that I think that's only a logical

00:34:03stepping stone for them. If a government already has vast amounts of power but wants to continue to consolidate power and grow

00:34:10Grow their control. Mhmm. The best tool to do that is through financial control. And as you mentioned at the beginning of of our pod, the CBDCs are the kind of the ultimate tool for that right now. Right.

00:34:22And the the only real

00:34:25kind of

00:34:26counter to CBDCs

00:34:28is

00:34:29Bitcoin is cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that are actually decentralized and useful and can provide privacy. Right. It's only those things that can be used to counter Counteract the effects of CBDCs

00:34:40once they come because they will come.

00:34:42And so I think that there's a there's a concerted effort to slowly shut down the usefulness of cryptocurrency.

00:34:48I think, like, the the approach of

00:34:51Senator Warren is not something that will come to pass and that There will be, like, a a total ban on cryptocurrencies, especially not Bitcoin. Right. But I think what can happen is that that they understand that if we can't use these things. While preserving our privacy. If we can only use Bitcoin in a transparent,

00:35:08surveilled way where our our identity is attached to our transactions. Right. Where there's no privacy tools to be able to use to

00:35:15to prevent other people from viewing the things that we do without our consent,

00:35:20Then it loses the vast majority of of its

00:35:23its ability to give freedom.

00:35:25And I think that's the effort there is is rather than banning Bitcoin entirely,

00:35:30The goal is if you can strip away the privacy and strip away

00:35:34the the parts of the ecosystem that allow it to be used in a way that that cannot be controlled by the government or cannot be surveilled at the very least,

00:35:41then you can prevent it from being a tool that's used to to protect the individual from the overwhelming power of the state. And I I think, like, that's my overarching goal that I see for, like, senator Warren and and and broad broad swaths of specifically the the regulatory body of the United

McIntosh:00:35:58So

00:36:00I think that's overall, I think that's a pretty good summary of what's been going on. I would, I would encourage

00:36:05the

00:36:07listeners

00:36:08if they have any interest in this and they should.

00:36:12But we will have links,

00:36:14in the show notes to comments where you can go make comments for this. I would encourage you to take the time to go do that. Understand what's going on.

00:36:22It's now is really the time to push back. It's not after it passes.

00:36:27Yes.

00:36:29That would be a mistake.

00:36:32We're not it's all is not lost if if it does, but it would certainly be a It'd be a blow. I mean, it would be.

00:36:40I think

00:36:41the end result of of what you were talking about with If if all of this came to pass and they basically kinda make it where it's this surveilled

00:36:51state,

00:36:53The only role Bitcoin has in that is a store of value for things like these ETFs,

00:36:58which I mean,

00:37:00I don't care about them, but that's not really what Bitcoin was created for.

00:37:05And I think that's very important to keep

00:37:10in mind in all of this. You know? We lose so much

00:37:14if if this happens. And I know well,

00:37:18I wanna wrap this up,

00:37:20this part of it,

00:37:22I guess, by saying, I I know that Bitcoin

00:37:28I guess

00:37:29well, let me say it like this.

00:37:31I wished

00:37:33privacy had had a stronger emphasis

00:37:36in Bitcoin from the start. Absolutely.

00:37:40I know there's not a whole lot of emphasis on it. I know there are things that are going on.

00:37:46But with all of this stuff that we see,

00:37:49that

00:37:50the these attacks that are ramping up, I would love to see it. Unfortunately,

00:37:54I'm not

00:37:56with a software engineer that can code this kind of stuff. This is not my forte. I can't read through the Bitcoin core

00:38:03code and contribute and this kind of thing. But I would love to see more people get involved

00:38:10specifically

00:38:10in the privacy

00:38:13that, in my opinion,

00:38:14need to be built out

00:38:16as soon as is reasonable.

00:38:18Right? We don't we just like with all things Bitcoin. We can't rush this stuff.

00:38:23It's way too important. But as soon as it's reasonable, we need to be moving some of these things along

00:38:29that will bake this into the protocol

00:38:33because we've seen so much

00:38:36acceptance

00:38:37at this point of Bitcoin

00:38:39that

00:38:40if, by the government, I should say, at least in the United States, that if

00:38:45we bake this into the protocol, I think I think it's game over. I don't I mean, if they can't tell what you're doing when you're transacting, then

00:38:54I don't care what

00:38:55Financial rules they make. You know what I mean?

00:38:59Yep. As long as they don't outlaw it. And if they do, then I guess I'll be an outlaw. I mean, I don't know.

00:39:05I I don't know. Probably shouldn't say that on the air, but

00:39:09but, you know, I mean,

00:39:12I don't I don't see that happening, though. To be honest, I mean, specifically, I don't I don't see that being,

00:39:19a rule,

00:39:21unlike I mean, Nepal, for example, they've actually outlawed cryptocurrencies.

00:39:25I don't I don't know if you've heard this, but it happened in 2021.

00:39:30And it was because stupid people were scamming people,

00:39:34not in Bitcoin,

00:39:36actually.

00:39:38You know,

00:39:40I don't think that's gonna happen here in the United States.

00:39:43We are getting a division between these casino coins

00:39:47and Bitcoin. And yes, scams can happen on Bitcoin. We've seen it in the past,

00:39:52but

00:39:53the entire thing was not set up as a scam.

00:39:57So there is a difference.

00:39:59You mentioned freedom.tech,

00:40:01your website. And,

00:40:03I guess it's a newsletter. Correct? I I I want you to talk about that. I actually meant to bring that up upfront and forgot. So since we touched on that, let's go ahead and Discuss that for just a second before we move on.



I guess it's a newsletter. Correct? I I I want you to talk about that. I actually meant to bring that up upfront and forgot. So since we touched on that, let's go ahead and Discuss that for just a second before we move on.  Yeah. Yeah. Before we do, I do wanna kinda touch on what you were just talking about. Okay. Absolutely. I I definitely agree. I mean, you're you're preaching with the choir when you when you talk about making

Seth:00:40:24changes to Bitcoin's protocol that improve the privacy. It's something something I've wanted for years, and it it's the main reason I got involved with Monero years ago, and I'm still a huge Monero fan is

00:40:34is that

00:40:35The protocols that bake in privacy at the base layer

00:40:39benefit far more people. Right. Because you don't need to understand even the need for privacy Right. To gain privacy, and it means that even people who don't care about personal privacy contribute to the broader privacy of those who do see that need. There's there's so many benefits there, and it it is something I would love to see come to Bitcoin. I I do think that at this point,

00:40:59Because of all the the institutional adoption and everything that people have clamored for Mhmm.

00:41:04Unfortunately, in my opinion,

00:41:06It's very, very difficult to get some sort of a sweeping change like that put into into Bitcoin at this point. I think it's difficult. Not impossible, but difficult. But I I I would say, I think the thing that

00:41:18that would help to put some pressure on those who do have the the ability, who do have the tools, who do have the influence

00:41:25Is to just talk about that you want Bitcoin to be more private. Just be public about your love for privacy. I know that it sounds a little strange, but

00:41:33I think that's one of the problems is that the most privacy loving individuals usually aren't on social media or aren't talking about these things actively. And so it can feel like there's not a desire for privacy within the Bitcoin space. Right. But I I think we have seen that start to shift publicly, but I think something where, like, Every every one of your listeners can can help by talking about how, like, hey. I would love to see Bitcoin be more private. Like, what are the things people are building here? What are the tools I can Today. What are some of the ways that you could see it being more private?

00:42:02I mean, I think the

00:42:04the approach that Monero has taken

00:42:07Is, like, the one of the safest

00:42:10and yet most effective approaches to bringing privacy to a to a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

00:42:16Because, Really, to have strong privacy, you need to hide

00:42:20the sender, the receiver, and the amount. If you leave out any of those pieces, specifically if you leave out amount, Mhmm. It gets a lot harder to to protect any of the other things, because a lot of the the ways that you can trace cryptocurrencies,

00:42:32Even if it's hard to tell exactly who is sending money to who, if you can see the amount and you can follow the amount as amounts small amounts get peeled off, as change gets sent back, You can use that amount to be able to to unveil a lot of what people are doing even if the other things are hidden. That's why, like, if you use a coin joint protocol like Samurai Whirlpool.

00:42:51Mhmm. You have to use fixed amounts. So you enter pools that are a specific size. And the reason for that is so that if you're all mixing the same size input and output,

00:43:00You can gain privacy from it. But if you mixed different size inputs and outputs, different amounts of Bitcoin in each one, it would be trivial to trace through. So the the amounts is an important part. The tricky the tricky thing that comes into effect is when you talk about Bitcoin and you talk about hiding amounts,

00:43:16What that would mean is that the the simple auditability

00:43:19that has become

00:43:21important in Bitcoin circles, at least in in Bitcoin narratives Right. Would be lost. You would not lose the ability to audit Bitcoin. And that's a lot of the confusion

00:43:30Is that it it doesn't mean when you hide amounts like how Monero does it with what are called confidential amounts,

00:43:36you don't lose the ability to audit

00:43:39The amount of Bitcoin in existence. Interesting. But it does mean you rely on a bit more cryptography

00:43:44to audit the amount of Bitcoin in existence, And that would open up a potential risk for hidden inflation.

00:43:50That risk is very, very, very, very, like, infinitismally

00:43:53small

00:43:54Because the cryptography and the code is so well understood and mature at this point. Right. But there is that risk. So it it's hard to get that through when a lot of the narrative around Bitcoin is is how sacrosanct the 21,000,000

00:44:06Sure. Is. Mhmm. And this would put us, like I said, I I think an infinitesimally

00:44:12small risk

00:44:13that that that could be lost in some sort of a hidden inflation event.

00:44:17But the the privacy you gain from adding,

00:44:20the amount is is really immense, and it it enables so many other

00:44:24approaches to privacy to be built out on top of it. So

McIntosh:00:44:28I don't know if if you know the detail of this, and I'm not I'm not looking for minutia, but in general, how do they how do they hide that? Is it like a ZK roll up

00:44:40where the kind of the top level knows.

00:44:43You could you can buy cryptography,

00:44:46know that

00:44:47If I have this value at the top level, well, then all this other stuff has to be. It has to amount to that amount or whatever. But I just botched completely that explanation.

00:44:57I'm sorry. But

00:44:59does that make sense?

Seth:00:45:01Yeah. I think it's it's a it's a reasonable intro there. I think the so, like, for background,

00:45:05I have long been involved with the Monero community, and I do have a pretty deep understanding of this stuff. So I'm happy to happy to dive into that. Okay. So the the way that Monero

00:45:14hides amounts and the way that it maintains auditability,

00:45:17is that Monero uses something called confidential amounts to hide the amounts. Okay? Essentially, what that means is it's a it's a zero knowledge proof,

00:45:25which I know is a a big buzzword, but, that is what it is. It's a very simple zero knowledge proof where when you create a transaction,

00:45:32you also create a proof to go along with it that proves that the amount that you're sending in the transaction

00:45:38Is correct. They didn't generate any amount of Monero that that doesn't match the amount on the input side. Essentially, you're just proving that the inputs and outputs balance out And that no false Monero was created in the transaction.

00:45:51That proof is able to be verified in a way that doesn't reveal anything about the amount. Right. Miners can still check that there was no

00:45:58inflation, that you didn't try to cheat the system because they can take that proof and validate it with without knowing anything about the amount. That's where the zero knowledge proof part comes in.

00:46:08And so you're still able to audit individual transactions that way. The other way that auditability is maintained is that When you mine Monero,

00:46:16the actual coinbase output, the the amount of Monero that's created in each block, that is totally transparent.

00:46:22That's not hidden by confidential amounts or anything like that. So you can still do the the simple napkin math addition to see how much Monero has been created through the mining process

00:46:32just like in Bitcoin. There's actually no difference there, which a lot of people don't

00:46:36don't understand.

00:46:37But the so when it comes to the transactions,

00:46:40I mentioned how confidential amounts work.

00:46:42The the only risk there is that if the cryptography

00:46:46behind that zero knowledge proof Or the implementation of that cryptography is flawed. Mhmm. There is the potential for someone to be able to create Monero out of thin air And hide it. Again, it's like that's a an infinitesimally

00:46:59small risk because the actual cryptography that's used here

00:47:03is, I think, over a decade old at this point. Very, very well understood. And when it comes to 0 knowledge proofs,

00:47:09very simple.

00:47:10So it it's It's a very, very, very small risk, but that's where that little bit of risk happens is if someone can create a proof that's fraudulent,

00:47:18but that looks like it's legitimate to minors and anyone else the chain. That's where the risk comes in.

McIntosh:00:47:25Interesting.

00:47:26I

00:47:27I'm aware of Monero. I don't think I've ever actually owned any.

00:47:31And I knew about the, the privacy benefits of it, but I've, I've never heard the details of this. Is there some

00:47:39resources that we could put in the show notes as well in case somebody wants to dig into that any deeper.

Seth:00:47:46Yeah. Definitely. I mean, the I'll send you some some links to some point, but the simple get Monero.org website is the kind of Official, but unofficial since there's no official company or anything behind Monero. It's the that's the main website to get started on, but I can send you some other resources as well. Okay. Very cool.

McIntosh:00:48:05Yeah. Unfortunately,

00:48:07I think that

00:48:09well, it's certainly possible that that could be implemented

00:48:13into Bitcoin. And maybe if things get bad enough, it will be just as a defense mechanism.

00:48:20Unfortunately,

00:48:21I think certainly in the current climate. I don't think it would necessarily go over so well if somebody's been proposing that merge request or whatever.

00:48:30But, it's good food for thought. Now

00:48:33given the current constraints, how can people what's the best way for people to protect themselves, to speak. I would assume it's CoinJoins.

00:48:42Correct?

Seth:00:48:44Yeah. Yeah. When it comes to Bitcoin, I think the

00:48:47the best

00:48:48So I kind of view it as 2 2 things. The the first thing that you need to protect yourself against in Bitcoin

00:48:54is having your identity connected to your usage of Bitcoin. And that That one can seem the most daunting to people, but I think that once you actually take the plunge and use some of these methods to acquire Bitcoin

00:49:06without giving over your ID. Mhmm. It's really not as difficult as it seems at first, and it's very refreshing to know that your identity is not directly connected to exactly how much Bitcoin you own and everything you do with it. So the the avoidance of this KYC that we talked about earlier

00:49:23is the the biggest step towards privacy in Bitcoin that you can do. I mean, if you're if you're gonna do one thing, it's just stop using Coinbase, start using HODL HODL or BisQ Right. Or AgoraDesk. There's lots of options.

00:49:34Because that means that even if someone sees your activity on chain,

00:49:38there is no way for them to directly attribute your identity to it outside of, like, physically seeing you, knowing who you are, and watching you make a Bitcoin transaction.

00:49:48So it's it's a very, very important first step, and that gets you miles ahead of the vast majority of Bitcoin users

00:49:54and

00:49:56gets you out of the vast majority of the dragnet surveillance that happens today. So that I think is the first and most important step. Once you've done that,

00:50:04really the best tool today is samurai wallet,

00:50:07or Sparrow wallet, which is, made by someone else, but it's a desktop wallet that's absolutely fantastic,

00:50:13and incorporates a lot of the privacy tools of samurai wallet. Okay.

00:50:17And they yeah. Their their approach is just it's it's proven. It's time tested.

00:50:22Works very well. They've got a lot of good people behind it. That's that's normally the way that that I push people for privacy on their

McIntosh:00:50:29time. We have an entire episode actually about the p2p,

00:50:35exchanges essentially, like.

00:50:38So, the listeners can go back and look at that. I will include that in the show notes as well. My show notes are gonna be really long this time, and that's cool.

00:50:46But,

00:50:47very good. Very good. That'll get people started. Do you maybe do I don't I have no idea. Do you have, like, a YouTube channel? I guess you probably don't.

Seth:00:50:56Yeah. So I don't. I have a a blog called Set for privacy.com.

00:51:00Okay. It has a lot of stuff and a lot of links out. I don't have a YouTube. It you do well, I have a YouTube channel for my podcast. It's an audio only podcast. So to be clear who are looking to go further into this, and I would strongly encourage them to do that.

McIntosh:00:51:15You know,

00:51:17I'm just trying to get as many resources as possible. I would add one more.

00:51:22I'm on,

00:51:23Bitcoin,

00:51:25and

00:51:26It's a great way to get KYC free Bitcoin.

00:51:29So,

00:51:31I'm supporting the network. I'm earning some corn,

00:51:34and I have KYC

00:51:36free Bitcoin at the same time. So I love it.

00:51:40I would point that out as an option. I know that scares a lot of people.

00:51:45It's really not that hard.

00:51:48But, yeah. Very cool. Alright.

00:51:51Awesome.

00:51:52I, oh, I have 1 last topic, and then we're gonna wrap up.

00:51:58I've been trying to figure out how to say this.

00:52:02Bitcoin Twitter, it can be very toxic.

00:52:06I think, frankly, the security people on Bitcoin. Twitter may be even more toxic.

00:52:15I will say you do a great job

00:52:18of managing

00:52:19these things when people get their feathers ruffled about something that you've said

00:52:25and this kind of thing.

00:52:27Why do you think though

00:52:29that, is it because people are just I my guess is it's because people are so passionate about privacy.

00:52:38Why why is it like that? I mean, it it can be frankly off putting to people who are kind of

00:52:44looking at that from the outside.

00:52:46You know what I mean?

00:52:48Oh, yeah. It's like mommy and daddy are yelling at each other. What am I nice to do.

Seth:00:52:55Oh, I, Yeah. This is a this is a topic I have thought

00:53:00A lot of a long time about this is something I've

00:53:04interacted with a lot. That's

00:53:06it's something that's one of the most saddening parts of being in the cryptocurrency space and being in the privacy space because both have a

00:53:13especially when it comes to privacy in the cryptocurrency space. There's a there's a very

00:53:18toxic

00:53:20maximalist

00:53:21holier than thou attitude that is common. And it's really unfortunate because

00:53:26The the approach that many take in the space

00:53:29only dissuades people from taking actionable steps towards personal privacy. Because when you're first starting to to realize, like, hey. I need

00:53:37I need to improve. I need to take steps here.

00:53:40But you start to wade into the resources, and you realize that there's this feud that is going on where people are name calling and doxing each other and yelling at each other on Twitter, and you're seeing this back and forth.

00:53:52What do you think people are gonna do? I mean, people are either going to just have to blindly pick because they're not gonna have to wade through a feud. And so they may end up using a tool that's

00:54:01malicious or not nearly as, competent or run by people who are happy to to cede ground to the state,

00:54:07or they just say, nope. I'm out of here. And, unfortunately, I have many, many, many, many, many instances of people

00:54:15in in my DMs and signal messages, etcetera,

00:54:18Let's say, look. I tried to wade into,

00:54:22making my my phone more private, but then there's this whole drama that I don't understand about Graphene OS and other stuff going on. Or I tried to wade into making

00:54:31my Bitcoin more private and gaining some financial privacy, but this there's this whole, like, green versus red thing, and samurai hates It's Wasabi, and Wasabi hates samurai. And I see them fighting all the time. And Mhmm. It makes people go, I'm just I'm not even gonna bother. Like, it's not worth my time. I can't go through this. I can't wait through this. And it's really disappointing as someone who is extremely passionate about bringing people into the world of personal privacy. Yeah. And it's something I've tried to fight back against. But

00:54:56If I knew

00:54:57if I knew why

00:54:59this was such a problem in the space,

00:55:01I would hopefully have solved it already. Right. But it's something that I I haven't been able to figure I think

00:55:07the kind of the assumption I make is just that the people who are building the the truly

00:55:11state resistant tools

00:55:13Are understandably under a lot of pressure. Right.

00:55:16And so it it leads to a lot of a lot of paranoia and a lot of

00:55:21Kind of defensive toxicity.

McIntosh:00:55:23Right.

Seth:00:55:24I that's the only thing I can really think of beyond just the fact that Many, many people who are absolutely brilliant also

00:55:31suffer in other areas Mhmm. And have some struggles.

00:55:34It could be that, but it it's really hard to say. So many individual cases of this that, obviously, it's it's certainly not a one size fits all thing, but

00:55:42it's tricky. I wish I knew the answer. It's something that I I try to fight against and try to avoid the

00:55:47toxicity and yet weighed into these things to help people understand the the tools at their disposal. But it It gets messy, and it's something that has to change if we want the average person to be able to jump in,

00:55:57see the need for privacy Right. Find the route the road to getting to those things and actually using the tools.

McIntosh:00:56:03Well, I appreciate your level headedness

00:56:05in all of this. I and I mean that. And I I'm sorry I sprung that on you. It was not No.

Seth:00:56:11It's It's a good question. But yeah.

McIntosh:00:56:13I I what I genuinely

00:56:15was curious as to your thoughts on that. So,

00:56:20as I wrap things up, one of the things I always do

00:56:24is I ask the people who I'm interviewing what their favorite book is. I'm a reader,

00:56:30And I love, for one thing, to find new books to read, but it does help me to understand where people are coming from. I've gotten some very interesting answers,

00:56:40to be honest.

00:56:41Some quite unexpected.

00:56:43Yeah. So I'm gonna ask you. You can pick 1 or a couple. I I can't have a whole list, but a couple of your favorite books.

Seth:00:56:52Okay. That's that's tricky.

00:56:55I'll give you so I'll give you 2 that are maybe recency bias Okay. That I've really liked.

00:57:01One is

00:57:03the Dune trilogy, which I know has become kind of in vogue with the Dune movies, but I was a very late comer to those. You're talking about the original. Correct?

00:57:11Yeah. Yeah. Dune, Dune Messiah, children of Dune, the the ones by the original author, not the sun. And when did you first read those?

00:57:19Maybe 2020 Okay.

00:57:21Great.

00:57:22Mhmm. Yeah. I missed those somehow when I was growing up and and reading sci fi.

00:57:28On the other end, I'm a big military history buff. Mhmm.

00:57:32And I just recently went through a 3 part series on the Pacific War by E and W Toll.

00:57:37With you. I don't know the name of the series off the top of my head. Look it up. It was absolutely fantastic, and it's, kind of opened my eyes to a different part of World War two.

00:57:47I'm I'm in this weird place where I'm very anti

00:57:50war and kind of anarchist slash cryptoanarchist,

00:57:53but I have a passion for military history. So Yeah. Yeah. I don't really know what that means about me, but I I still really like reading military history books. So We are allowed to have

McIntosh:00:58:04Schizophrenia.

Seth:00:58:07The paradox of man. I I would

McIntosh:00:58:10honestly put myself in very much the same boat.

00:58:13As I have gotten older, I've I've I've gotten a lot more

00:58:17antiwar for one thing when you have kids,

00:58:20and then your kids get to be the age where,

00:58:23it's one thing for you to go off to war. It's another one is your kids. That puts a whole different perspective on it. And I've learned a lot, frankly, over the last 20 years,

00:58:33that It's way too long for this podcast

00:58:36to go into.

00:58:38But

00:58:39I grew up I mean,

00:58:41One of my favorite movies is Gladiator. I mean, you know, and I do watch I mean, like,

00:58:47every once in a while, I pull out, the Tom Hanks movie about storming,

00:58:52Saving Private Ryan, you know,

00:58:54for example.

00:58:55Mhmm. I tend to watch a lot of,

00:58:58more stuff centered around World War 2,

00:59:01frankly, because I

00:59:03even though that war was caused by finances,

00:59:06to be honest,

00:59:08I believe it least was a legitimate war. I mean, there was there was a Yeah. A threat. There and there was an existential threat going on.

Seth:00:59:16One of the few that's So even though relatively reasonable. Frankly, people caused that war,

McIntosh:00:59:22and set it up

00:59:24essentially without being too conspiratorial.

00:59:29That is a war that frankly I would have I would have signed up for

00:59:33knowing the consequences of it. You know? I don't wanna get too philosophical about all that, but, yeah, that's I I understand that,

00:59:41certainly. Do you have any other others? You've mentioned Snowden's book. Maybe we should that may not be your favorite book, but let's go ahead and throw it in. What is this book called? Absolutely. Yeah. I only let that one out because I mentioned it earlier. That's for me, that was the

Seth:00:59:54the key to understanding personal privacy. Okay. I went from Absolutely no care in the world about personal privacy, Google Homes in every room in my house,

01:00:04and all the all the spyware Spyware you could possibly spend money on Right.

01:00:08To suddenly turning around and replacing everything in my home and confusing my wife why suddenly all our electronics are missing. It was a it was quite a revelation for me and and a good one. Mhmm. I went a little too deep on personal privacy initially,

01:00:20but I I finally came around and found a little bit more level headed approach. But for me, that was the the book that really opened my eyes. Great.

McIntosh:01:00:29Dune,

01:00:30was

01:00:32Might have been the 1st sci fi book I read.

01:00:36And at the age I was, I was quite young. It was Mhmm. It was I actually did read the whole thing.

01:00:43When I came back, when I was in my late teens, I reread the the first 3 books, which were the only ones that were out back then.

01:00:50And, I have read all of them except the very latest one that just came out a few months ago, if I'm not mistaken.

01:00:59Frank was definitely a much better writer than his son. They have different styles.

01:01:05Mhmm. I'll say that. I haven't read any by the sun yet. I do enjoy them, but

01:01:11they are different. I I like how they fill in the backstory.

01:01:16If you read fantasy

01:01:18at all,

01:01:19I would strongly encourage you if you've never read Tolkien's works,

01:01:23to read Oh, yeah. The Hobbit and then the Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion

01:01:27and and then go out and read all of his son stuff.

01:01:30Okay? Because it's very similar.

01:01:33I

01:01:34there will never be any so I'm just gonna fanboy for just a second. There will never be an equal for a token in my opinion.

Seth:01:01:41I would agree with that.

McIntosh:01:01:42Frank Herbert is the closest thing that there is.

01:01:46And by the way, kids, George r r Martin, not even in the ballpark. Okay?

01:01:51So I'm sorry if I just offended half of the audience.

01:01:56I have read 1 or 2 of his books, and, frankly, I just couldn't stomach anymore.

01:02:01But Uh-huh. Regardless,

01:02:04very good stuff. Frank has a lot of thoughts. It's well and I will say this.

01:02:10They're hinted at

01:02:12in his books. His son unpacks

01:02:15a lot more of the kind of the computer side of things, okay,

01:02:20about how things may develop down the road

01:02:23and

01:02:24the implications

01:02:25that can come about through

01:02:27through

01:02:29technology advancing, which it's going to.

01:02:32I mean, it's undoubtable,

01:02:34or whatever the word would be. So, anyways, I will I will stop there, but great list. I will add those.

01:02:42Probably what I should start doing is putting these links on Amazon so when people buy them, it helps the show out. You betcha. For now, I will just make links to them,

01:02:52and and we'll do that. Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners? First of all, I really appreciate you coming on. I appreciate your time. It's been a great conversation.

01:03:02But is there anything you wanted to leave our our listeners with?

Seth:01:03:06Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think first, thank you. So glad to be able to come on and Chat about what I view as really important topics and and also just chat about fun topics. I think it's it's it's good that you blend in a little bit of, a lighthearted topic at the end there. So grateful for that. I think the only thing I wanna leave people with is

01:03:22is just that if this kind of piqued your interest about

01:03:25Open source tech, about privacy tools, about,

01:03:28this specific fencing proposal or the the indictment on Tornado Cash.

01:03:33That's a big focus for me recently is kicking off and driving a new publication called Freedom.Tech.

01:03:39Okay. Starting as a blog, gonna be a podcast as well. Great.

01:03:42And just go there. Take a look at what I've written so far. We have,

01:03:46multiple new contributors jumping in to to start to write about

01:03:50All things FreedomTech.

01:03:51I think it's going to be,

01:03:54hopefully, the most useful single resource For staying ahead of the curve when it comes

01:04:00to empowering human freedom when it, through technology.

01:04:03So really excited for that. I would definitely recommend taking a look, and that Goes much deeper into a lot of the things that we talked about today. Great. Yeah. We just covered the surface.

McIntosh:01:04:12I always encourage the re the

01:04:14readers. Sorry, guys.

01:04:16The listeners,

01:04:18you know, dig in.

01:04:19We're we cannot cover everything. There's just no way. But, yeah, that's awesome. I appreciate your time, Seth,

01:04:26and we're gonna wrap things up right there.

01:04:29Alright. That was a really great conversation

01:04:33with

01:04:34with Seth. So I hope you enjoyed that. We're going to move on from here

01:04:41to our supporters.

01:04:43We do have some support this week. While I'm

01:04:47finishing opening that up. I would like

01:04:50to point out that

01:04:52as a way of supporting the show and as a way to earn some sats,

01:04:56you can

01:04:58you can create clips

01:05:00of the podcast.

01:05:02For the current episode, if you were to go in and make a, you know, at least a 32nd to 1 minute long clip or so.

01:05:10Post that on fountain as an example.

01:05:13I'll boost that back 500 sets. If it's an older episode, it would be 300 sets, and that's a way that I can get visibility for the show. It's a way for you to earn some sets as well. You provide value,

01:05:24and I provide value back for that. So,

01:05:27I would love to see people taking

01:05:29advantage

01:05:30of that

01:05:34so who are these supporters? These are people who,

01:05:38have taken the time to get a podcasting 2 point o app or to go to

01:05:43the new podcast apps.com

01:05:45website and look up our podcast

01:05:48and boost to show support for the show. They do this to, you know, get a message,

01:05:56to us,

01:05:58to

01:06:00just

01:06:01a lot of times, they don't even have a message. It's just a boost just as a way to provide that value back for the value that they're getting,

01:06:09from the Generation Bitcoin podcast. So,

01:06:12we also have streaming as well. I Cannot take the time to go through all the people who stream.

01:06:19Eventually, we will get to the point where we will not be able to cover all the people who support and,

01:06:24boost, and we'll have to provide a cutoff.

01:06:27We're not there yet, so this is everybody who's boosted.

01:06:32And let's see here. I should be almost to it.

01:06:36I'll be glad when I get moved over, and I can just do this in helipad.

01:06:40Would be great. As of now, I'm still using.

01:06:46Great tool, but,

01:06:48I would much rather.

01:06:51So our 1st boost came in,

01:06:54from Karen at Mere Mortals.

01:06:56He just finished up his value for value,

01:07:00podcast season. I think it was our 3rd season. It was a great season.

01:07:05Well worth taking a listen to

01:07:07to learn more about the value for value ecosystem that we're building here on podcasting 2 point o.

01:07:14And,

01:07:15as I you know, I talked about my mom,

01:07:19last Thursday,

01:07:21or excuse me, last Saturday,

01:07:25on that recording.

01:07:27And, she recently passed away.

01:07:30I think all of these are kind of about that.

01:07:35So bear with me, please.

01:07:37We're doing okay.

01:07:40It's a process,

01:07:41and,

01:07:42you know, we'll we'll be alright. But,

01:07:45yeah, we're we're still kind of in the middle of it. It's actually

01:07:49Wow. It's been almost exactly a week from right now. That's crazy as I finish up this recording.

01:07:56So condolences,

01:07:57Macintosh. My mom took a turn for the worst this week, and I also don't think I'll be fully prepared for the end. Best wishes.

01:08:04Thanks, Karen. I appreciate that. I appreciate your support.

01:08:08It was 2022. It was row of ducks, and thank you very much.

01:08:12Yeah. I'm a I'm afraid you won't be regardless

01:08:16of when.

01:08:19It's just the nature of it. You know? I think after 10 years, you would have thought I would have been prepared for it, and I was

01:08:25to an extent,

01:08:27but,

01:08:28but not completely.

01:08:32So

01:08:33hypersensitive

01:08:34asaurus,

01:08:38sent in a boost of a 1,000 sats,

01:08:41and it was just a heart. And I appreciate that. I got the message. Thank you. I appreciate

01:08:47that very much.

01:08:49And we got another 1,000 sats

01:08:52from

01:08:53Radrac

01:08:55c.

01:08:56It's r a d r a c s e. I don't know how I'm supposed to pronounce that, but he said he or she said, Man, I'm sorry for your loss, and thank you. I appreciate that.

01:09:06Again,

01:09:08as well means a lot. And then,

01:09:11Berno,

01:09:13sitting in another I sitting in a 1,000 sat boost and said, I'm really sorry to hear about your mother, and I wish you the best. And thank you, Berna. I appreciate that. So,

01:09:23we in total

01:09:25let me go ahead and total this up real quick. We're always looking

01:09:30for the month

01:09:32to, to get a total of 25,

01:09:35250,000 sets, but roughly $50. I'm gonna have to actually adjust that, I guess, as the market goes up,

01:09:44you know, to account for

01:09:46for inflation,

01:09:48for price inflation anyways, a good kind of inflation,

01:09:51of Bitcoin.

01:09:53So, I'll probably start looking at that fairly soon.

01:09:57So in total for this episode, we looks like we had right around 66100.

01:10:02It was 6542,

01:10:05after Satoshi

01:10:06stream took their part, which is supposed to be 1%.

01:10:11By the way,

01:10:12speaking of inflation of price,

01:10:15Earlier,

01:10:16I was talking about

01:10:18good chance we could break 35,000.

01:10:21By the way, as I do this part of the recording to wrap things up tonight,

01:10:26our block time. I'm not gonna put this in the thing in into the show notes, but just to give you a

01:10:34idea. It's now 814918.

01:10:37814,900

01:10:39and

01:10:41eighteen.

01:10:43We're now at 35,730,

01:10:47and I believe

01:10:48we touched

01:10:5036,000

01:10:51or at least came very, very close to it. Let me double check my little chart here.

01:10:57Oh, I should have it right here.

01:10:59Actually,

01:11:00yeah, 35,992

01:11:03according to this chart. So really, really close to 36,000.

01:11:07It does look like

01:11:10there's a strong possibility,

01:11:12I think, that we're going to stay above it.

01:11:16We closed above 35,000,

01:11:18so that was certainly good

01:11:21for the day.

01:11:23And in fact, I brought that up. It was 35,441.

01:11:29So all that's happened in just the last few hours, and that's what Bitcoin will do. This is why we DCA people. Don't try and figure this out. Just know.

01:11:38Hey. We break this down into 4 year cycles. We've got this whole happening thing. We've got

01:11:44institutional adoption. We've got more adoption by people.

01:11:48You know, number is going to go up over time.

01:11:51There you go. I don't know what that number is going to be. I don't try and predict that, but it will go up.

01:11:58Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:00the next 2 years

01:12:01between now,

01:12:03November 1st,

01:12:04and

01:12:06at the end of December roughly.

01:12:08Please don't quote me on this, but somewhere in the Q4 at least

01:12:12of 2025,

01:12:14We are going to be

01:12:15in the bull market part of this,

01:12:18and it's gonna get crazy. And it's not just gonna be Bitcoin. We're not gonna be talking about all the other stuff. But as Bitcoin goes up,

01:12:26you always see these other altcoins,

01:12:29casino coins

01:12:31follow along, and that's fine. They will get blown out

01:12:35over time,

01:12:37but here we are.

01:12:39So buckle up. Be prepared. I'm going to keep repeating this

01:12:45over the next several years.

01:12:48PCA.

01:12:49Alright.

01:12:51So that's the end of that. I do appreciate all of that support.

01:12:55There's a there was not any breaking news other than price go up.

01:13:00Right?

01:13:01Nothing really

01:13:02this week. I'm gonna kinda skip that section because we're getting kinda long. There's a lot of links in the show notes this week. Seth had a number of links. I've got Finsen stuff in there. Please take the time to go and and

01:13:15comment

01:13:16about Finsen. If you if you are knowledgeable enough to understand

01:13:21that they are trying to take our privacy, that this is an overly broad act,

01:13:27that

01:13:30frankly, this is supported by the constitution.

01:13:33Please go comment on that.

01:13:35Okay? They need to hear from us.

01:13:37So there's a number

01:13:39of links in there. I made a couple of links to the blog post that we were talking about that Seth had written, and that's actually on his Freedom Tech site. There's a lot of great information there. I put Seth's links in here as well. Seth for privacy

01:13:56on Twitter,

01:13:57his foundation link and his freedom tech link. If you're on Twitter, I would advise you to follow those. Plus, I also put a link to the

01:14:06peer to peer,

01:14:08decentralized exchange

01:14:10ways to buy

01:14:12Bitcoin

01:14:13anonymously.

01:14:14Okay? So Take a minute. Maybe you don't normally go through that, but go through the show notes,

01:14:19and click through some of those links. Take a look at that stuff. Alright. So we're gonna wrap this up. Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2 point o. We are a value for value podcast. We do not have sponsors. We do not have

01:14:33sizing. In that way,

01:14:34I do not get steered

01:14:36incorrectly

01:14:37because somebody is paying me some money. You can support this podcast in 3 different ways through time, talent, and treasure. If you wanna support the podcast and have some time or talent, I got a lot of stuff. Shoot me a message on Twitter, please. I'm on McIntosh

01:14:51Fintech on Twitter, or you can email me at McIntosh at jendashbtc.com.

01:14:57If you wanna support the show with your treasure with Bitcoin,

01:15:02and please, of course,

01:15:04You can do this through your strike app or whatever. This should not be the coin that you're saving.

01:15:09God forbid. But you can,

01:15:12instead of going and buying a Starbucks, which is now almost $7 from large Starbucks. It's insane.

01:15:18I remember when it was five thirty five. I shut up, grandpa. That was 2 weeks ago. It's I mean, it's almost there. It really wasn't that long ago. It was 5.35, and now it's 7.

01:15:30Five thirty five because of our taxes. It was, like, $5 plus the taxes.

01:15:34Anyways,

01:15:36sorry.

01:15:36Get that little rant in.

01:15:39Instead of doing that, buy $5 on strike

01:15:42in Sats.

01:15:43Send that to your Bitcoin wallet, whether that's an Albie wallet or your fountain app or whatever,

01:15:49and support your favorite podcaster or podcasters.

01:15:53Try not to be too discriminatory.

01:15:56I'm only gonna support 1 purse. There's a lot of podcasts out there. If you listen to more with 1 podcast you should be and getting value from them. You should be supporting more than 1.

01:16:05Anyways,

01:16:07if you like the content,

01:16:08Most of all, I would love it if you would just tell your friends about Generation Bitcoin podcast. You can give us a review,

01:16:15whatever. Or tell people, hey. This is great. Awesome. That does help too. Alright. Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful, and I would love to hear from you. I'm on Twitter at Macintosh Fintech. Like I said, I'm on Mastodon at Macintosh

01:16:29at podcast index dot social.

01:16:31Hey. Stay humble, friends. Go out and make it a great week. I'll talk to y'all

01:16:36next Monday.
