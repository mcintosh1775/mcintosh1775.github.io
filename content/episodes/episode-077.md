The IMF and the World Bank have been around since 1945. The goal of the IMF is "[The International Monetary Fund (IMF) works to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for all of its 190 member countries. It does so by supporting economic policies that promote financial stability and monetary cooperation, which are essential to increase productivity, job creation, and economic well-being.](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/IMF-at-a-Glance)" Are these goal and policies helpful to the countries receiving them? Research shows that it might not be helpful.

Let's discuss both this and a possible solution.
