1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.140
McIntosh: Hey, Sat Stackers, today is November 26th, and this is episode 147 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host,

2
00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:11.265
Mcintosh, and today's episode is the final countdown.

3
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.630
I hope,

4
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.090
I hope you had

5
00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:46.445
Europe's final countdown playing in your head.

6
00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:55.309
You know? Whatever. Sorry. That was bad. But, yeah, with all apologies to Europe, the band. We are marking

7
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.950
next episode

8
00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.885
Will be our last as generation Bitcoin.

9
00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.645
In the stretch,

10
00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:07.045
we will have an episode on

11
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.369
the 30th,

12
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.890
if all goes well,

13
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.890
or the 31st if I get delayed for some reason

14
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.215
as it happens sometimes with my work. And then we'll be taking the month of December off as I've explained.

15
00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:21.335
The next episode,

16
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.854
I will be revealing the new name. I

17
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.880
I registered it yesterday,

18
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.140
and,

19
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.640
I will be preparing that website

20
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.440
and

21
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.945
all of that. And at some point during that time,

22
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:37.245
during the month off,

23
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:41.240
the site will move probably fairly early, actually.

24
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.479
The podcast itself will move

25
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.640
McIntosh: over to the new name. So

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.880
but that's for next week.

27
00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:49.785
McIntosh: Market update.

28
00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:54.665
To market update, we had a weekly close a few hours ago, 37,400

29
00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:56.780
and 54.

30
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.060
If you go back and look at the chart that I've drawn,

31
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.460
we are tracking

32
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.540
right on target.

33
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.485
McIntosh: We have spent

34
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:08.325
interesting little

35
00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:10.245
thing that happened here.

36
00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.485
Essentially, the weekend

37
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.310
McIntosh: Above

38
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.150
above our our level of support

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.950
resistance

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.069
at 37,500.

41
00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:22.405
McIntosh: .

42
00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:25.845
And then tonight, we kind of fell below it.

43
00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:27.685
McIntosh: We closed the week

44
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.510
at, like I said,

45
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.390
37,454,

46
00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.030
slightly below that 37,500.

47
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.269
We are still below it.

48
00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:46.135
It could pop back above it, but, you know, we've nicely went up and touched the upper part of that ascending channel.

49
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.610
We are very strongly looking like this ascending channel is going to play out. So it may you know, it it could possibly still

50
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.290
absolutely go down

51
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.035
thirty six six.

52
00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:02.875
Maybe a little bit higher depending on how far into the week that we are.

53
00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.310
But the time is coming when this

54
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.510
bottom part of the channel, so to speak, will force it upwards. I mean,

55
00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:14.394
It's either that or it falls out and

56
00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:15.515
which is

57
00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:16.635
statistically

58
00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:17.435
unlikely.

59
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:19.435
So I'm suggesting

60
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:20.955
that, you know,

61
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.840
We're looking at basically

62
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.840
very early December,

63
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.200
somewhere around 3rd, 4th, 5th.

64
00:03:28.885 --> 00:03:31.945
It's going to be forced above this level of 37,500

65
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:34.345
if it hasn't already

66
00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:39.770
permanently established itself above that or at least semi permanently,

67
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.390
whatever. But,

68
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.770
but, yeah, we'll we'll see how this works out, but

69
00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:46.895
The

70
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:52.575
the pattern that we discussed last week still in play. We've still got this upward channel. We're still

71
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:57.540
well within that. We're Actually, right in the middle of it right now.

72
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.739
We are below that level of resistance

73
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.980
for now at 37,500

74
00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:05.694
Ish,

75
00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:09.375
and you'll see that we've we've spent a good bit of time here.

76
00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:18.220
It will be very interesting. I think this will prove to be a Pretty solid level of support once we get above it, but we will see.

77
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.715
So, of course, as always, that is not trading advice. I'm not trading this. I do not suggest that you trade this. As always,

78
00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:27.835
I suggest

79
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.315
that what you should do

80
00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:31.595
is DCA.

81
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.150
I

82
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.750
saw a chart this week, which I have mentioned in the past. If you've

83
00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.349
since the top

84
00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:41.785
69,000,

85
00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:43.145
that

86
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.225
you are actually in profit,

87
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:51.449
which would be a pretty good place to be considering the price of Bitcoin that it is right now.

88
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.729
In other words,

89
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.425
you've started buying Bitcoin at $5 a day, $10 a day, Whatever it is, $100

90
00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:01.025
a day. I don't know.

91
00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:04.305
But you've been doing that since 69,000,

92
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.110
And here we are $30,000

93
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.830
below that and you're in profit. That's what DCA

94
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.070
Bitcoin will do for you.

95
00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:19.855
So don't forget that. Don't you know, we do these chart patterns, and it's fun, and

96
00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:24.100
it gives us an idea of maybe where things are gonna Go in the market.

97
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.300
But this isn't trading advice. This isn't a trading podcast.

98
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.380
I'm not some trading guru,

99
00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:33.535
Anything like that.

100
00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:35.695
I want you to keep that in mind.

101
00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:40.735
Always. DCA. Alright. The difficulty adjustment happened on the 26th.

102
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.450
It did happen.

103
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.330
Yes.

104
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.730
Which would be today,

105
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.130
25th.

106
00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:51.384
Excuse me. The last adjustment was on the 25th.

107
00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:54.905
It must have happened late on 25th.

108
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.040
Pretty sure it was saying 26 earlier was when it was estimated.

109
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.880
But regardless, it happened on the 25th,

110
00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:03.764
5.07%,

111
00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.485
so another upward increase. I think this was

112
00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.324
it's been quite a few now that it's been upward.

113
00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.199
We've had more hash coming in. We've had new servers coming online.

114
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:24.185
It's no longer summer, so at least here in the upper in the Northern Hemisphere. So,

115
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:25.305
you know,

116
00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.825
the large areas of Texas that, you know,

117
00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.960
massive numbers of minors are being turned on and off

118
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.740
for energy reasons,

119
00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.259
during the heat of the Texas summer that's come to an end.

120
00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:46.245
So we're all and and Bitcoin price is up, so older miners are getting put back online.

121
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.060
The mining dip that is why the mining difficulty keeps ratcheting up, just to be clear.

122
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.760
McIntosh: So

123
00:06:54.235 --> 00:07:00.415
McIntosh: And our block height, by the way, I I if I haven't said this earlier, our block height at time of recording is 818-653.

124
00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:02.960
McIntosh: I must have already said that.

125
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.020
Alright.

126
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.139
McIntosh: Let's go through the rest of these statistics.

127
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.340
We do have the having coming up in April.

128
00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:13.665
Looking like it would be around April 23rd,

129
00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:16.545
so we're kind of narrowing that in.

130
00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:17.985
Fees.

131
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.730
Let me bring up mempool.space.

132
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.845
Fees have been high, but not as high as they have been. Right now, we're looking at

133
00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:36.185
58, 67, and 77 sats per v byte. So a little bit lower than they have been, but the pool is definitely

134
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.270
Still full. We're at 1.21

135
00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:39.229
gigabytes.

136
00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.669
I think I saw it sneak down into the twenties at 1 point very briefly.

137
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:48.245
Alright. So let's jump on in.

138
00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:50.805
As I said,

139
00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:53.445
next episode will be the last one.

140
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.330
I had a realization today. It's kind of funny.

141
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.890
McIntosh: I was listening to the Bitcoin

142
00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:03.865
Dad podcast. And,

143
00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:08.264
McIntosh: so the Bitcoin Dad and a guy named Chris from Juniper,

144
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:09.625
Networks,

145
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.150
who he was the founder of Juniper Networks,

146
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.550
creator of Juniper Networks, and, does a number of podcasts including,

147
00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.435
I wanna say Linux unplugged,

148
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:25.514
and a number of others. But, anyways,

149
00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:28.395
they do a weekly podcast, and

150
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.600
McIntosh: I realized

151
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.480
that

152
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.800
Bitcoin Dad was

153
00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:39.235
McIntosh: Kind of like a calm version of myself.

154
00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:42.915
He they were talking about something,

155
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.290
and it was something that well, it was actually the,

156
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.450
it's what I just talked about,

157
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.150
the the censorship

158
00:08:50.565 --> 00:08:54.585
of, transactions by the mempool. And, of course, I get extremely

159
00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:56.665
agitated,

160
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.745
shall we say, about that,

161
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.470
type thing because it's and because it's super important, and

162
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:18.850
I know he believes that it is. It's that's not the case at all. It's just, you know, he Comes across very calm. I thought that was kind of funny. He never I don't think I've ever heard him raise his voice on his podcast. Just one of those thoughts I had. Whatever.

163
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.770
But, I also got my seed signer this week.

164
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.910
So this is,

165
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.570
this will be used for my Bitcoin,

166
00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:31.265
mining, which I've discussed in the past

167
00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:33.105
to move the mined

168
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:39.630
sets off my mining pool. Of course, I wanted to move them straight into a nice hardware wallet

169
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:48.865
that was set up just for that. I interviewed seed signer, as you all know, a few weeks ago. I've been looking at their product for a while,

170
00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:51.280
and I actually bought a nice,

171
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.440
It was not the aluminum one. It was the black one. Well, it's,

172
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58.820
sorry. Not the silver one, the black aluminum.

173
00:10:00.045 --> 00:10:03.665
I went ahead and ordered it assembled. I did not assemble this one myself,

174
00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:08.145
but I'm going to be putting it together probably this week.

175
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.850
I think I wanna take the time to document that at least in terms of a

176
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.730
paper,

177
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.145
like Blog long form type thing, and then I will be posting that hopefully,

178
00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:22.225
on Seth's,

179
00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:25.105
Seth for privacy on his new,

180
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.420
webpage, which

181
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.500
frankly escapes me at the moment, but we talked about it on his episode back in episode 141.

182
00:10:35.165 --> 00:10:36.705
So, as a

183
00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:38.225
kind of a tutorial,

184
00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:46.070
we'll see how all that turns out, but I am looking forward to Putting that together to finishing that up, and,

185
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:52.410
it's a really nice looking device, to be honest. Now I bought the aluminum one. It was a little more expensive.

186
00:10:53.154 --> 00:10:54.774
I think this one was $150

187
00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:59.014
more or less. It might I think it was a tiny bit more than that with shipping,

188
00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:02.110
But, had some nice instructions,

189
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.750
had some everything was that you need was in there, the little micro

190
00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:12.985
SD card, the, unit itself, of course, which which has the Raspberry Pi,

191
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:18.180
single board computer, or whatever they call it in the box.

192
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.180
The the cable that you would need to power it, so it's like a micro

193
00:11:22.695 --> 00:11:28.475
USB cable that you connect up to your seed signer, and then maybe you plug it into your

194
00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:30.315
into your computer,

195
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37.420
and it will power it up. Now it only does power. It doesn't actually provide data, and they make that very clear

196
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.860
on the documentation.

197
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.740
So

198
00:11:40.615 --> 00:11:44.635
Very well done. Got QR codes to go with it. Our QR,

199
00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:46.155
like, blank QR,

200
00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:47.115
pads,

201
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:53.610
And actually a little sticker that said seed signer, which I could choose to stick on my laptop. I probably

202
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.490
won't

203
00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:55.529
simply

204
00:11:56.165 --> 00:12:00.105
Because of the nature of what it is, I really like it, but

205
00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:02.745
that's the kind of thing I don't really want advertised,

206
00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:04.185
shall we say.

207
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.290
Yeah. So there you go.

208
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.650
Very cool.

209
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.370
Very, very cool. I will provide another report on that,

210
00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:20.815
after I get it done, if I get it done before Thursday, which I probably won't,

211
00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:25.135
to be honest, I'll talk about it then. Otherwise, I guess it will wait

212
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.750
until next year.

213
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.910
Just an update,

214
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.990
on Argentina

215
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.025
as well. Things seem to be progressing sing along down there,

216
00:12:36.805 --> 00:12:39.545
probably about as well as we can expect.

217
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.080
President,

218
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.040
Malay is very intent

219
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.800
on shutting down the central bank. He has made that very clear.

220
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.135
McIntosh: Hold on just a second. I need

221
00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:56.175
to need to get some of my tea.

222
00:12:56.955 --> 00:12:58.975
McIntosh: I actually need to take the tea bag out.

223
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:08.540
In my opinion, and I may be mistaken in this or at least this may not one of everyone's opinion. If you leave the tea in there too long, it will make it

224
00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.574
Almost bitter. I don't know.

225
00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.214
I like it to a point, and then,

226
00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:15.735
you know,

227
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.830
I don't want it to be any stronger, essentially.

228
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.550
So the tea and the honey,

229
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.870
nice. Alright.

230
00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:26.295
But, he

231
00:13:27.095 --> 00:13:34.155
look. I'll go through some of this when we go through the news. Time will tell. We're very early. He hasn't even taken office yet,

232
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.780
But I I'm

233
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.500
seeing promising things, frankly. You know? This is a long haul as I always say. I talked about,

234
00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:47.084
Bukele, last week or the week before. I mean, here he is

235
00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:54.660
running for his second term, and I'm I'm not convinced at this point. I think he's done a lot of good things, but

236
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.339
history will will show how this goes.

237
00:13:58.995 --> 00:14:01.735
And we are in the middle of it. And it's very difficult

238
00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:05.095
to see at this point. So next

239
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:08.215
week will be the last episode of generation Bitcoin.

240
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:12.670
I did get an email back from the Generation Bitcoin people.

241
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.149
They will not be coming on the show.

242
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.550
That doesn't change anything.

243
00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:19.635
They're busy. It's,

244
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:24.375
the time of year when frankly, actually, the person I was

245
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.990
Corresponding with I believe she's in a master's program or,

246
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.829
bachelor's program,

247
00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:34.629
if I'm remembering correctly from Jimmy

248
00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:35.954
Jimmy Song's,

249
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:37.995
interview with them. And,

250
00:14:39.115 --> 00:14:39.615
so,

251
00:14:40.795 --> 00:14:44.430
it's it's finals. I get it. So they won't be coming on,

252
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.310
but we will be going forward with

253
00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:54.884
the new name. And like I said, I'll be sharing that name next week,

254
00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:59.590
but I'm excited about it because I think I finally got

255
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.570
McIntosh: Something I I was trying to explain this

256
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.130
to my wife last night. I'm not really sure I'm doing a good job of it, but

257
00:15:08.704 --> 00:15:11.285
The words mean something. It's something that

258
00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:18.690
I think it'll have traction. We'll see. I'm not doing a good job of explaining it, but I'm really looking forward to

259
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.170
McIntosh: it. We'll be revealing that next week in case I just haven't said that, like, fourteen times already.

260
00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:26.225
But,

261
00:15:26.865 --> 00:15:28.485
I'm gonna have a new website.

262
00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:32.805
I would like to get a chat server set up. I'm looking at that.

263
00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:34.725
It might be a little quiet

264
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:44.870
to start with and frankly probably will be, but I would love to, you know, start building more community. That's one of the things that I'm

265
00:15:45.315 --> 00:15:47.415
Really trying to do here.

266
00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:51.255
I love the fact that we've got some regulars who

267
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.510
Boost in , who, you know,

268
00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:08.740
I kinda feel like I understand a little bit about their lives and this kind of thing, and that's terrific. But, we'll go ahead and start actively building community through, you know, through this chat setup. I would also like to

269
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.100
start doing,

270
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.660
live broadcast.

271
00:16:15.635 --> 00:16:20.135
That is something that I'm thinking about as well. Now that's gonna be tricky,

272
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.335
and especially considering the way that I

273
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.750
Think and talk.

274
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:32.225
What it will mean is that I will have to spend a lot more time and show prep

275
00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:33.025
because

276
00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:44.050
just to give you a little inside baseball here as we say, typically, what I do is I will sit down and write out an outline of what I'm going to talk about. And

277
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.089
so I'm not really winging it,

278
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.050
but

279
00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:53.195
I am sitting here actively thinking as I'm talking

280
00:16:53.815 --> 00:16:57.195
about kinda what I'm gonna say next and this, that, and the other.

281
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.210
And what that really does is it slows me down,

282
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.690
and so I end up going in and then clipping out a lot of spaces,

283
00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:09.264
dead air as I would say, and

284
00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:15.105
to to try and tighten it up. Now I'm by nature a fairly slow speaker,

285
00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:16.304
but

286
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:24.530
Being put in that position where I'm just, you know, thinking, thinking, thinking for 60 minutes, and it's going to slow me down even more.

287
00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:26.615
So if we're gonna do this live

288
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:31.655
to keep things from, you know, grinding to a halt and everybody's saying, oh my

289
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:39.440
Goodness, McIntosh. You could, like, speed this up. I'm going to have to spend more time in show prep. Right? I'm gonna have to

290
00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:43.394
Dial in, maybe not rehearsed beforehand

291
00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:46.195
really, but, you know, really think through

292
00:17:46.495 --> 00:17:49.040
what am I gonna be talking about, Kind of the subtopics

293
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52
of those main topics and all that kind of stuff.

294
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.135
So looking forward to that, that will bring in some video as well. I'm Hoping

295
00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:11.810
we will see. Not that I'm necessarily interested in having myself plastered all over the Internet, but, I think there's a lot of There's a group of people that really like video. I may be one of those, to be honest,

296
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.830
because of the details that it can bring up

297
00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:19.924
Across things like when I talk about trading view

298
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.284
and show you,

299
00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:22.725
you know, how

300
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.899
This chart, I mean, yes, I can put it on Twitter

301
00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.580
or whatever, but

302
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.500
McIntosh: it would be a lot easier

303
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.705
McIntosh: it would be a lot easier Do this kind of in real time on a video

304
00:18:34.245 --> 00:18:34.745
setup.

305
00:18:35.284 --> 00:18:37.544
So that's one of the things I'm looking at doing.

306
00:18:38.325 --> 00:18:40.265
I have a whole list, actually.

307
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.940
December task.

308
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.780
Hey. I can mark the first one off. It's not even December. I'm gonna do that right here.

309
00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:50.685
Where's the strike through? Done.

310
00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:56.605
Register new domain. That has been done. Move podcast. Okay. So I'll be moving

311
00:18:56.905 --> 00:18:57.965
over to Castapod.

312
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.070
And so when you go

313
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.270
to castpod.newdomainname,

314
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.470
that will actually take you to

315
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:09.695
where the website,

316
00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:11.695
where the podcast will be hosted.

317
00:19:12.075 --> 00:19:13.535
If you've ever looked at Castapod,

318
00:19:13.915 --> 00:19:20.300
they have some community type functionality built on top of it. But to be honest, it's not super

319
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:27.945
it's not great at this point. I put it that way. So it's not really something I'm gonna Actively be talking about or encouraging.

320
00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:30.565
I may set up a,

321
00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:31.705
Mastodon

322
00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:33.784
instance. I have

323
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.080
Thought about that, and that may be certainly

324
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39
possible. So

325
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.135
we would possibly do something like mastodon

326
00:19:42.435 --> 00:19:43.815
dot new domain name.

327
00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:46.935
And then that would take you to the Mastodon instance,

328
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:56.340
and you could join that and use that as to again, to for community building, but as a way to join the Mastodon

329
00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:59.220
Federated Universe. So,

330
00:20:00.255 --> 00:20:03.055
so Moo podcast set up live video podcast,

331
00:20:03.775 --> 00:20:05.475
and we've got a great

332
00:20:06.175 --> 00:20:06.675
article.

333
00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.669
They recently did this at a conference. It was,

334
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.070
Blue put it on,

335
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.669
and it worked spectacularly

336
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.830
from everything that I can tell.

337
00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:27.760
So, one of the guys, I think he's CTO of the company, he was kind enough to write a medium article about it, and I have that written down. And then along with a number of other little things

338
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.600
kind of in that vein in order to do live video. Now that may not happen

339
00:20:34.825 --> 00:20:37.885
right out of the gate, January 1. I'm just gonna be honest,

340
00:20:38.425 --> 00:20:42.445
but it is a goal. I'm going to hopefully buy that little,

341
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.730
Linux,

342
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.250
server I've been talking about for, gosh, a long time, probably most of this year.

343
00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:55.405
It's called the BLINK GTR seven Pro is the one that I've decided on. It's an AMD,

344
00:20:56.825 --> 00:20:58.540
nice little setup. So I'm planning on

345
00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.820
running

346
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.380
probably Ubuntu on it.

347
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.955
So then I would actually run Reaper on that. I would do my live, I've, if I've got video editing software

348
00:21:10.655 --> 00:21:15.955
that I need to do for this video stuff, then I will probably have that as well.

349
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:29.365
And then, of course, like I mentioned earlier, I'm gonna try and write an article for Seth's website. So that month, Even though I will not be recording, we'll be extremely busy, and I will get through as much of it as I can.

350
00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:33.820
You will still be able to get a hold of me at gendashbtc.com.

351
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.500
So that's the Generation Bitcoin website.

352
00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:44.335
For the foreseeable future, although I will not retain that domain name forever, there's just no use in doing that.

353
00:21:44.715 --> 00:21:48.240
I will move over. Right now, I'm using a WordPress website,

354
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.559
which historically is something that I've done a number of times for

355
00:21:55.075 --> 00:21:55.715
Other little,

356
00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:59.015
for other small businesses that I've helped out.

357
00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:00.375
I'm

358
00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:05.500
I'm I think I'm gonna do something different, and I haven't decided what yet, but

359
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.920
WordPress is kind of

360
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.060
I don't know. You look at a WordPress website, and it's like, you know it's WordPress,

361
00:22:13.554 --> 00:22:18.775
which is fine. It's just I I would like to be different, maybe. I don't know.

362
00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:30.179
That's up in the air. I'm not sure what the point of all that is other than I need to rebuild the website onto the new domain name whether I move WordPress over or choose to do something different.

363
00:22:30.735 --> 00:22:33.315
I would also like to get more of a Noster

364
00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:34.755
presence.

365
00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:36.595
I'm not sure

366
00:22:36.895 --> 00:22:40.410
just And I don't talk about Nostra very much on here, but

367
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.010
I'm not sure. I love the idea of Nostra,

368
00:22:44.895 --> 00:22:46.915
decentralized privacy focused

369
00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:49.955
financial rails based on Satoshis.

370
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:51.635
I love all that.

371
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.460
I think it has its drawbacks including the fact that there really aren't that many people using it. Although,

372
00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:03.635
One nice size side of that is it kinda gives you an outsized,

373
00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:10.320
sphere of influence if you're actually using it. So if you're Putting out content there,

374
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.520
and people notice it. It's a lot easier to get noticed there than say on Twitter.

375
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.840
Even though I tweet

376
00:23:19.075 --> 00:23:20.135
Stuff routinely

377
00:23:20.515 --> 00:23:21.975
multiple times a day.

378
00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:26.215
The reality is some of those most of those get very little traction,

379
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.990
and even though there's,

380
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.230
McIntosh: I don't know,

381
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.390
a 100,000,000

382
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.895
maybe Twitter users. I don't I don't know how many? There's a lot.

383
00:23:38.315 --> 00:23:42.495
And I have tweets. It'll have 3 or 4 people that'll view it, which is

384
00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:43.855
frankly depressing.

385
00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:45.055
McIntosh: So,

386
00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:52
anyways, we'll see. I would I would like to do that. I would love to have something because there's always you got Mastodon.

387
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.520
You've got LinkedIn.

388
00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.275
You've got, Not that I do anything on LinkedIn, but you've got

389
00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:00.875
Nostril, you know, you've got multiple

390
00:24:01.415 --> 00:24:10.230
platforms. It would be Really great. And I know they're please, you don't need to send me a boost. I know there's stuff that's available that will let you do that

391
00:24:11.315 --> 00:24:15.815
Were you kind of blasted out everywhere at once? I don't know. But it gets

392
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:17.255
very tiresome

393
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.230
Even just posting

394
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.030
when I make a new episode, I've got 3 places I have to go and post that.

395
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.855
That'd be something I'd love to solve as well.

396
00:24:27.575 --> 00:24:28.875
So hopefully, 2024,

397
00:24:29.655 --> 00:24:30.155
regardless

398
00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:31.355
of

399
00:24:31.975 --> 00:24:34.955
what's going on in the world, which we don't know.

400
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.310
In terms of this podcast, I hope that we are moving forward and building

401
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.510
a better

402
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.550
product,

403
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.670
really.

404
00:24:45.164 --> 00:24:55.840
I view this as a product in the sense that even though people don't pay me for the ability to listen to it, You know, we're a value for value podcast be in

405
00:24:56.779 --> 00:24:59.520
from everything that I can tell, the way that

406
00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:03.745
I get more value back whether that's people helping or

407
00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:06.225
monetarily through Satoshis.

408
00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:10.029
The way that I increase that is by providing

409
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:15.549
a better value experience. Why would I start up another chat server to

410
00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:20.544
Something else to deal with. Well, because that's building community. It's providing

411
00:25:20.845 --> 00:25:22.225
a better experience

412
00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:24.145
and hopefully more

413
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.690
value to the listeners who are

414
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.290
part of this podcast.

415
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.810
That's gonna be my goal, my focus in 2024.

416
00:25:33.804 --> 00:25:36.225
Does that make sense? I I hope it does.

417
00:25:37.005 --> 00:25:39.745
I think it does. It does to me.

418
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.300
So that will be my focus in 2024. We're gonna kick it off here at the end of 2023

419
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48.180
with as much of this as we can do,

420
00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:52.345
and we'll keep rolling from there. I do plan

421
00:25:52.645 --> 00:25:53.625
on going to

422
00:25:54.165 --> 00:25:58.630
the Bitcoin conference in July in Nashville. I would love to meet up

423
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.570
with listeners. I if we have enough people who are going, and I have no idea if we will or not,

424
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.090
maybe we could get together at, like, a pizza place or something

425
00:26:08.695 --> 00:26:10.155
and just have a little party.

426
00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:18.640
I don't know. I haven't that's literally, like, the first time I've thought about about that, but I would at least love to meet up with with people.

427
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.520
So

428
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:20.640
alright.

429
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.760
Let's see. What else do we have tonight?

430
00:26:25.255 --> 00:26:26.955
We should talk about our supporters.

431
00:26:27.655 --> 00:26:30.315
They had some boost in the last few days.

432
00:26:31.655 --> 00:26:36.090
I I do think next Here, as we move into this new

433
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.809
thing, one of the one of the things I

434
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.049
one of the things I need to do is

435
00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:45.695
Decide on some changes I want to make to kind of the format of the podcast.

436
00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:57.590
One of the things I would like to do, To be honest, and this is actually something that your listeners could help out with, I would love to get some value for valued music on here, at least clips of it.

437
00:26:59.425 --> 00:27:02.325
Because probably my clips that are on here have gotten stale,

438
00:27:03.505 --> 00:27:07.205
McIntosh: so to speak, and, you know, we're changing the name of the

439
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.960
McIntosh: Podcast, it'd be a great time to do this. If you have any suggestions for

440
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:19.065
some value for value music that's out there on Wave Lake or something like that.

441
00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:22.905
I will try and figure out at least how I can

442
00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:26.710
maybe initially just clip it in, and then Ultimately,

443
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.230
there is a way now that people

444
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:31.350
do,

445
00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.645
splits where, like,

446
00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:36.525
if

447
00:27:37.225 --> 00:27:37.725
well,

448
00:27:38.505 --> 00:27:41.085
splits have been around for a while, but specifically,

449
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.690
McIntosh: Let's say I've got

450
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:53.245
McIntosh: I'm just gonna say the Foo Fighters because they're the first thing that comes to mind. They're certainly not value for value, but let's say I've got one of the Foo Fighters songs at the start of the podcast.

451
00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:57.165
When you're listening to that either streaming or boosting that,

452
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.420
Part of that would go directly to them, and then

453
00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.860
it would switch

454
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.580
after the song

455
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:08.695
to whatever the normal was if it was just me, if I was the only one,

456
00:28:09.235 --> 00:28:12.055
or me and a cohost or or whatever. Right?

457
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.970
I'd again, it's

458
00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:18.929
it's like. I don't talk about the music stuff on here very often, but

459
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.289
it definitely

460
00:28:21.405 --> 00:28:27.905
Seems to be gaining a a good amount of traction, actually. I have high hopes for it. I really think

461
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.110
This may move forward the live

462
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.830
podcasting stuff and make it a little more

463
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.149
important, which would be really nice.

464
00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:47.440
So we'll see how that turns out, but that's one of the things I would like to do. If you have some suggestions for kind of Start end song type stuff. If there's a

465
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.280
a 15 to 22nd

466
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:59.750
clip, that would sound good. I'm not gonna have well, the end, I can do a whole song as I do now. I do a much longer thing now, but the start needs to be,

467
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.170
a shorter amount, I do not have a mixer

468
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.330
right now. If I had a mixer, we could, like, bring the sound down

469
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:09.690
on the music,

470
00:29:10.695 --> 00:29:12.395
Make a bed. Let it play underneath

471
00:29:12.775 --> 00:29:15.355
while I'm talking over it at the start.

472
00:29:15.975 --> 00:29:19.115
But for now, we got kinda gotta keep out of that.

473
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.860
So if you have some suggestions about that, feel free to

474
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.620
boost those in and let me know or send me an email

475
00:29:27.155 --> 00:29:27.655
at mcintosh@gen-btc.com.

476
00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:36.375
Okay. I guess I'll I've only had one boost, and that's fine. I thought I had two.

477
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.130
Apparently, I did not. From episode 146, I got

478
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.250
a 3333

479
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:43.410
boost,

480
00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:45.475
from Sir Michael,

481
00:29:46.335 --> 00:29:47.075
and he

482
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:47.875
said,

483
00:29:48.895 --> 00:29:53.315
listening on fountain. Thank you, Sir Michael. I appreciate that. And he said,

484
00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:58.220
Happy Thanksgiving. Did you see the fees paid for block

485
00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.260
81808

486
00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:02.175
seven.

487
00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:03.935
No. I did not.

488
00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:05.375
Not directly.

489
00:30:05.755 --> 00:30:11.215
I have heard about this, and I must actually gonna talk about it in the news already, but I appreciate that.

490
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:18.480
It's it's insane. So they this has actually happened a couple of times lately, and historically, this has happened

491
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.920
a few times.

492
00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:21.115
McIntosh: So

493
00:30:22.055 --> 00:30:22.955
you can

494
00:30:23.415 --> 00:30:23.915
overpay

495
00:30:24.855 --> 00:30:27.675
McIntosh: to have your transaction included in the blockchain.

496
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.040
So, literally, I could be sending someone

497
00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.360
10,000 sats,

498
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.120
and I could have a dollar a a dollar.

499
00:30:38.514 --> 00:30:41.894
A Bitcoin be the transaction fee, which would just be

500
00:30:42.195 --> 00:30:42.695
stupid.

501
00:30:44.434 --> 00:30:45.495
It has happened.

502
00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:48.169
There have been cases where

503
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:49.929
fees have been returned.

504
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.690
1 happened recently.

505
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.409
McIntosh: I'm not,

506
00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:56.325
To be honest,

507
00:30:56.625 --> 00:30:57.605
as a miner,

508
00:30:57.985 --> 00:30:59.445
I don't really like that.

509
00:30:59.985 --> 00:31:01.205
McIntosh: Not really a fan.

510
00:31:01.825 --> 00:31:04.164
I get it why they do it, but

511
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.179
Really, most of the time, these are bugs that need to be fixed.

512
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.780
I hope that

513
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.179
that that was the case here

514
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.865
where there was a bug and,

515
00:31:15.424 --> 00:31:20.725
maybe they've figured that out, and hopefully, they're fixing that in their wallet.

516
00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:24.700
I'm gonna look that up real quick. 8 let's see.

517
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.780
McIntosh: Block 818087.

518
00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:31.005
McIntosh: So

519
00:31:33.785 --> 00:31:40.200
yeah. I did. I definitely heard about this. If you look it up on a block explorer, you can go to Paul.space.

520
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.120
This happened

521
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.240
on 11/23,

522
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.100
probably UTC time, but,

523
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.800
4 days ago,

524
00:31:48.685 --> 00:31:50.385
McIntosh: About 4 o'clock in the morning.

525
00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:54.945
McIntosh: And just to give you an idea, the median fee was a 141

526
00:31:55.405 --> 00:31:58.070
sets. The fee span went from a 129

527
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.310
sats per v byte

528
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.710
to, let's see, 16,000,000

529
00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:05.005
917,160

530
00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:08.605
McIntosh: sats per  byte.

531
00:32:09.705 --> 00:32:11.085
The total fees,

532
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.610
McIntosh: I hope you're sitting down for this is 85.216

533
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.050
Bitcoin,

534
00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:22.605
which right now or at least at the time this was,

535
00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:24.945
mined was worth $3,000,000,

536
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.880
Almost $3,200,000.

537
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.440
McIntosh: The total block

538
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.040
was 91.466

539
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.440
Bitcoin,

540
00:32:35.885 --> 00:32:37.184
and that was $3,400,000.

541
00:32:39.245 --> 00:32:41.025
McIntosh: It was mined in the amp pool.

542
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:49.940
It is possible there was something going on that, you know, some exchange or whatever in the background, who knows,

543
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.055
or This was simply a mistake. I haven't heard one way or the other.

544
00:32:56.755 --> 00:32:57.655
I don't know.

545
00:32:58.035 --> 00:33:02.809
I wonder what the subsidies were, not the subsidies. I wonder what the fees

546
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.130
in Antpool were for that block when it got mined like.

547
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.650
To understand

548
00:33:09.575 --> 00:33:10.795
The it's 91.466

549
00:33:12.135 --> 00:33:17.195
Bitcoin, but that's divided up among tens of thousands probably of minors.

550
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.610
It's a much, much smaller amount per miner for that block.

551
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.290
Very, very interesting

552
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.850
kind of one of the little edge cases

553
00:33:26.645 --> 00:33:27.544
with Bitcoin.

554
00:33:28.404 --> 00:33:34.024
It seems like that only happened, like, a couple months ago or maybe even less. I mean, it's kinda weird

555
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:40.330
because you don't hear about this for a long time and then just boom all of a sudden now it's happened,

556
00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:44.065
a couple of times. So let's see. 123.

557
00:33:44.525 --> 00:33:48.145
Wow. We mined 4 blocks today in brains. That is awesome.

558
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.880
It's been tough.

559
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:57.160
1, 2, 3 the day before and then 1 the day before that. So that was the 24th and then not on the 23rd.

560
00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:04.445
2 on the 22nd, and then 1, 2, 3 on the 21st, and then a 4 day gap

561
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.340
Between 17th and 21st, that as far as I know is the longest I've seen brains go

562
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.020
since I've been mining,

563
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.540
early this year

564
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.580
on brains,

565
00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:16.565
without a block.

566
00:34:17.105 --> 00:34:18.485
So that was depressing.

567
00:34:21.105 --> 00:34:23.339
Let's look Look at the 7 day moving

568
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.260
average type thing here. See if it started to move up.

569
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.619
A little bit.

570
00:34:29.575 --> 00:34:33.755
Yeah. We've got this chart, basically, a 7 day average of the rewards.

571
00:34:34.855 --> 00:34:39.440
Essentially, in a graphical form is representing kind of this average Because

572
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.720
with so much

573
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:45.839
between one day and the next, it's you need a way to kinda average that out. So,

574
00:34:46.619 --> 00:34:59.970
very good. It does look like it's looking a little better. Just to give you an idea for my last block that I mined, and this essentially is for all the miners that I have in service. You get one reward. It's 0.00172902

575
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:05.890
Bitcoin. So

576
00:35:08.725 --> 00:35:09.225
11000th,

577
00:35:11.205 --> 00:35:11.705
almost

578
00:35:12.085 --> 00:35:13.145
12 thousandth

579
00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:14.345
of a Bitcoin.

580
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:20.790
I think I'm doing that math right. Pretty sure I am. But over time, it does add up,

581
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.830
of course, or we wouldn't be doing this.

582
00:35:24.674 --> 00:35:25.174
So,

583
00:35:25.555 --> 00:35:33.380
sir Michael, I believe I've never heard from you. I have heard of you from other shows, and I do appreciate you listening.

584
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.180
Absolutely.

585
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.339
And it was awesome to hear from you, so thank you very much.

586
00:35:39.705 --> 00:35:43.165
I believe yeah. I believe I've heard of you from other shows.

587
00:35:44.025 --> 00:35:48.205
McIntosh: You're definitely, I would assume, a night of the round table or a night of the,

588
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.610
McIntosh: no agenda table or however they say it. Very cool.

589
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:59.555
So aside from that little bit of news, which was Kind of an interesting little side note. I already mentioned

590
00:36:00.095 --> 00:36:03.315
mining difficulty. This was actually the 6th increase

591
00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:10.279
And going back 10 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 yeah. Going back 10 weeks.

592
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.279
And so we are now at an all time high in mining difficulty.

593
00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:21.735
That's simply a reflection. Like I said, it's the number of minors. It's the number of hash. It's

594
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.410
It's really all about that hash rate. What that means, we're at an all time high for

595
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.410
our hash rate, which is absolutely

596
00:36:29.265 --> 00:36:32.325
What we see, we're pressing in towards 500

597
00:36:33.745 --> 00:36:34.245
Exashash.

598
00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:37.205
492 Exashash per second

599
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:38.110
last,

600
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.550
seven day average.

601
00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.350
Yep.

602
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.830
fourteen day was 491.

603
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:50.565
Thirty day was four seventy three. So as we go back in time on these averages, you can see the number lowers, which

604
00:36:51.265 --> 00:36:54.085
is exactly what you would expect given that

605
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.269
We we see more and more hash rate coming online.

606
00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.109
So right now,

607
00:36:59.809 --> 00:37:06.855
the next difficulty adjustment, which isn't supposed to take place until December 9th, If it were to happen right now, it would be 1.06%

608
00:37:09.075 --> 00:37:09.975
down. So

609
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.190
I don't know. Maybe we've reached some sort of top

610
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.950
for now. I don't know where we can go with this because

611
00:37:18.635 --> 00:37:27.935
It's getting difficult enough even with the hash price that I think if things continue the way that they have been, we're going to start to see miners,

612
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.870
Public miners experiencing

613
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.270
extreme distress and

614
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.110
certainly in terms of their

615
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.990
finances.

616
00:37:36.405 --> 00:37:38.745
We will see. I know that sounds crazy

617
00:37:39.685 --> 00:37:40.505
with $37,000

618
00:37:41.445 --> 00:37:41.945
Bitcoin,

619
00:37:42.965 --> 00:37:43.465
but

620
00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:45.950
It's not. It

621
00:37:46.569 --> 00:37:50.430
might be really tough around the happening next year. We will see. Alright.

622
00:37:51.655 --> 00:37:53.675
Other news. Other news. Other news.

623
00:37:55.415 --> 00:37:56.395
.

624
00:37:57.015 --> 00:37:59.755
I thought this was very interesting. So BlackRock,

625
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.435
of course, largest,

626
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.060
basically, largest investment

627
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.300
firm in the

628
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.260
world,

629
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.954
who He's filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF.

630
00:38:12.895 --> 00:38:13.795
Back in 2022,

631
00:38:14.415 --> 00:38:16.355
apparently, they released a study

632
00:38:16.734 --> 00:38:17.635
that indicated

633
00:38:19 --> 00:38:22.700
That the optimal portfolio allocation to Bitcoin was

634
00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:24.619
84.9%.

635
00:38:26.155 --> 00:38:27.375
The remaining 15.1%

636
00:38:28.315 --> 00:38:37.059
can go to equities and bonds. I would not have believed it if I didn't see the document myself. It's right here. I've reposted it. And that is literally

637
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.579
what it says.

638
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.260
I've

639
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.255
they're very bullish on Bitcoin, if that's true. We'll see.

640
00:38:46.335 --> 00:38:50.275
If you entered at the all time high, like I said, you'd be up 40%

641
00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:56.720
even though we're still 40 plus percent off That all time high. That is the power

642
00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.800
the power of DCA.

643
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.960
Do not underestimate that.

644
00:39:01.954 --> 00:39:06.375
This is all getting posted on Twitter, by the way. You can follow me at McintoshFintech

645
00:39:06.835 --> 00:39:07.335
there.

646
00:39:08.275 --> 00:39:10.775
One very important thing I wanted to note.

647
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.080
It's probably the biggest news of the week, and I hope it doesn't go unnoticed.

648
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.080
There's a company,

649
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.840
up in Canada

650
00:39:19.955 --> 00:39:22.035
run by a a guy with a,

651
00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:25.655
anonymous handle of u t x o underscore one,

652
00:39:26.035 --> 00:39:26.830
o n e,

653
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.450
called nodeless.

654
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.450
Io. It looks I've never run it. It looks like and I've never used it. So it's open source.

655
00:39:35.245 --> 00:39:41.825
So you can run your own, or you can use his setup or her setup. It's basically a way to make it very easy to take money,

656
00:39:42.525 --> 00:39:43.025
Satoshis

657
00:39:43.645 --> 00:39:44.145
online

658
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.890
for businesses.

659
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.690
It's a really interesting looking

660
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:53.650
piece of software. Well, he lives in Canada, and apparently, they have decided

661
00:39:54.365 --> 00:40:01.025
They are going to investigate him and so on and so forth. So he got some type of notice. I don't know exactly.

662
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.580
He did say in his,

663
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.320
notice. He said, I am being investigated

664
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.400
for running an illegal money transmission business

665
00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:11.525
in Canada.

666
00:40:12.305 --> 00:40:12.805
And

667
00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:21.400
by the advice of his lawyers, he needs to shut down the main instance Sense of node list. So effectively, he's closing node list down.

668
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.960
The code is open source. It is still available. I would highly encourage

669
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.840
anyone

670
00:40:27.565 --> 00:40:30.225
who has interest in this to pursue this,

671
00:40:30.925 --> 00:40:32.145
posting it elsewhere.

672
00:40:33.085 --> 00:40:35.345
I think this is very valuable software.

673
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:39.070
I actually disagree that it's money transmission

674
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.870
business.

675
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:45.585
The reason why is because he's their argument Would be well, he's making a percentage

676
00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:49.165
off of what you know, if you have, say

677
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:58.839
Well, it's a percentage like whatever it is, and it's not very much. It's like 1% plus a 100 sats. So if I send a 1,000 sats,

678
00:41:00.035 --> 00:41:06.935
I mean, a 1,000 sats isn't very much, so it'd be a 100 sats of that. So 10% plus 1% of a 1,000.

679
00:41:07.235 --> 00:41:08.135
But if it's

680
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:09.410
McIntosh: 10,000

681
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.810
sats. It would still only be

682
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.650
McIntosh: a 100 sats plus 1% of 10,000, whatever that is. So,

683
00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:20.005
pretty reasonable,

684
00:41:20.704 --> 00:41:24.484
and that's why they're saying he's running a money transmission business. But,

685
00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:30.579
Look. This stuff has to be updated. This is the new world and, you know, I don't know.

686
00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:38.275
But I was very disappointed to see that. I Ask him if he would come on the show. I've not gotten a response. I'm sure he's inundated,

687
00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:40.914
McIntosh: with stuff,

688
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.860
and I get that. But, Yeah. It'd be cool to have him on the show.

689
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.885
McIntosh: I posted a chart from somebody else, but I posted a chart about

690
00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:54.405
the national income earned by the bottom

691
00:41:54.705 --> 00:41:56.885
50%. So in other words, the

692
00:41:57.319 --> 00:42:01.180
The lower half of the country, their share of the national income

693
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.299
has been basically going straight downhill

694
00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:05.420
since the

695
00:42:05.905 --> 00:42:07.605
19 eighties, since early

696
00:42:08.224 --> 00:42:08.724
eighties.

697
00:42:09.585 --> 00:42:10.085
And,

698
00:42:10.865 --> 00:42:13.285
it's sad. It went from 20%

699
00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:14.405
down to,

700
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.030
12%.

701
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.710
And

702
00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.230
this is I I think you could argue that this is

703
00:42:23.655 --> 00:42:35.500
representative of a number of things, but, I mean, our economy is just in trouble. And this is the world in general. The rich are getting I mean, You've heard the statement. The rich get richer, the poor get poor,

704
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.460
and

705
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.885
that's true. The rich are getting richer because they have money and assets that

706
00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:43.645
appreciate

707
00:42:44.185 --> 00:42:45.965
with interest real estate,

708
00:42:46.745 --> 00:42:48.365
not with interest, with inflation.

709
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:57.400
As inflation goes up, house prices go up, you're making more money if you own the house and you rent it out. It's that simple.

710
00:42:58.355 --> 00:43:04.535
If I'm living paycheck to paycheck and I don't have enough money to invest in a 401 k

711
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.869
or real estate or anything like that.

712
00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:12.750
I don't get any advantage from that, and I only get the disadvantages

713
00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:15.665
McIntosh: of inflation.

714
00:43:16.685 --> 00:43:19.665
Pay more at the supermarket. I went to the supermarket.

715
00:43:21.085 --> 00:43:27.710
McIntosh: I don't shop very much, but I went yesterday, And it's just like, man, everything I looked at was more expensive.

716
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.950
They had been it seemed like just a few months ago. I don't know.

717
00:43:32.424 --> 00:43:34.525
But, you know, we're doing good. Doing

718
00:43:34.904 --> 00:43:35.404
good.

719
00:43:36.505 --> 00:43:38.765
I posted some news about Malay.

720
00:43:39.144 --> 00:43:43.980
I'm not sure if he's gonna dollarize the economy, at least according to this article, we'll see.

721
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.780
I do know he's gonna take away their central bank.

722
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.660
I do know that he's basically going to

723
00:43:50.075 --> 00:43:51.135
Promote that

724
00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.095
capitalist,

725
00:43:52.395 --> 00:43:56.734
that business owners are not the root cause of their inflation.

726
00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:58.670
So that's good.

727
00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:00.589
So

728
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.790
generation Bitcoin

729
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.910

Fountain has a big one point o version coming up fairly soon.

745
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:17.445
It has actually not been released to the beta testers yet, although that would be happening, like, literally anytime in the next 24 hours is from what I can tell.
