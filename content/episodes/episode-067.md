What rights do you have to financial privacy? This week's news of the arrest of the creator of the Tornado Cash  anonymizing dapp sent shockwaves through the industry. Regardless of what happens with TC this will ultimately affect everyone. The United States has very clear foundational rights about privacy and in my opinion those rights are being shredded with Tornado Cash being the latest example.
