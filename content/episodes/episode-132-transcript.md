Unknown:00:00:00Hey, SatStackers. Today is September 24th, and this is episode

00:00:04132 of generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, Macintosh. And today's episode is on the Keynesian fallacy.

00:00:40Alright. Let's do

00:00:42this market update.

00:00:44The market closed a couple hours ago at $26,221,

00:00:51which is down, like, $300

00:00:52from the week before.

00:00:54Or, excuse me, from Thursday

00:00:57when we did our last episode. What that means

00:01:00is that we are now flirting again with this bottom level. I told y'all, I think Thursday.

00:01:07Of course, the end of the month is coming. We're 6 6, 7 days off,

Unknown:00:01:12I guess, from October

00:01:141st.

00:01:15So we will be closing

00:01:17a month on Saturday

00:01:20of this week.

00:01:22And I have told you that historically,

Unknown:00:01:25except 2 months, 2 times in Bitcoin's life, it has gone down in September.

00:01:30I think that's kind of a general trend in the stock market overall.

00:01:34There's different theories about that.

00:01:37The brokers come back from summer kind of

00:01:40vacation,

00:01:42whatever. They

00:01:44kind of rearrange their portfolios,

00:01:46sell off stocks. I I don't know. I don't know how much credence I give to that.

Unknown:00:01:52But the reality is that

00:01:55a number of times

Unknown:00:01:57in the past, Bitcoin has gone down. So we are a $1,000

00:02:01or so off of that level, meaning, you know, I think 25,000

00:02:05is what it opened up the month that

00:02:08so we're a ways off.

00:02:10So I may be incorrect, which is fine. I make mistakes,

00:02:14But we will see, we're flirting with that one of those levels right now, and we had a weekly close below it really,

Unknown:00:02:22or at least right on it.

Unknown:00:02:25So it's it's possible still, certainly. I'm not gonna say that it's 100% going to happen.

00:02:32I do not know.

00:02:34No real excitement this week. This week was actually the rest of the week was kind of boring. There's no news. There's one news item, actually. We'll discuss that when we get to the news section.

00:02:44But that's okay. That's this time of year, it's quite typical.

00:02:49Don't worry about it.

00:02:51Just keep stacking sats.

00:02:54As we always say,

00:02:55you don't worry about market price,

00:02:57really.

00:02:59You just keep stacking sats. The only thing that

00:03:02$25,000 bitcoin would mean is that we can buy some sats for just a tiny bit cheaper.

00:03:08So block height at time of recording

00:03:12is 809,236

Unknown:00:03:15block.

00:03:16The mempool is full as it has been.

Unknown:00:03:19Our difficulty

00:03:21adjustment

00:03:22looking on October 3rd, so just over a week away.

00:03:261.42%.

00:03:29So a down.

00:03:31So now that adjustment is looking a little closer to 0 basically.

00:03:36Our

00:03:38sats per v byte wow.

Unknown:00:03:41Am I reading this correctly?

00:03:43No. I'm not.

Unknown:00:03:45Sorry.

00:03:47Saw a really big number.

00:03:49I was incorrect.

00:03:50The average is 22 sats per vbyte. So still high.

00:03:54We've certainly seen lower even just a couple weeks ago, certainly.

00:03:59Remember it was 12 not too long ago. 10, 12, 8, something like that.

00:04:04But the mempool is full. People are bidding it up.

00:04:10And

00:04:11I don't know. We'll see.

00:04:15Matt Odell and Marty,

00:04:17Bent have a bet going on about whether the mempool is going to clear or not. I do not remember which one is on which side of the bet. I think Matt says that it will not clear

00:04:27by the end of the year, by the end of December 31st. I believe he's actually probably gonna be correct. We we may not see an empty MIM pool

00:04:36until

00:04:38the next

00:04:39bear market, which would be a long way off.

00:04:42That would be interesting,

00:04:45even though we're in a bear market. They say that the mempool,

00:04:48a lot of the transactions are being used by ordinals.

00:04:52I don't understand that, to be honest. I know that in the ordinals community, there's a big kerfuffle going

00:04:58on. Something about they're having to rearrange the way that they number the sats, and it's messing everything up.

00:05:05And I have no idea. I don't care. We've discussed ordinals to the extent that I'm going to On this podcast,

00:05:13not really a fan.

00:05:15It's an open protocol. They're allowed to do that. I eventually think they will eject themselves from the ecosystem, to be honest, because I think it will be unviable

00:05:24in the long term.

00:05:25And that's fine.

00:05:27I don't need ordinals to make a profit when I mine.

00:05:32From here, we're gonna jump into the topic. I prerecorded the topic earlier this week. I've had some extra time. My wife has been out of town. It's giving me extra recording opportunities. I've actually recorded 2 episodes. So this one

00:05:46and then another one, which I'm not sure if it will be the next one or not. We will see.

00:05:51So this one, to be honest, is a little

00:05:53I don't wanna say dark, but it's one of these episodes where we're dealing with a topic that's quite frankly,

00:06:01extremely important.

00:06:03And also,

00:06:04it can be a maybe a bit depressing. So be encouraged. In fact, the next episode that I've already recorded

00:06:11was very much upbeat.

00:06:14I don't wanna say it's the flip side of this, but Bitcoin is the answer to what we're fixing to talk about. Bitcoin is a sound

00:06:22store of value.

00:06:23It's a form of sound money. It, in my opinion, it will eventually be a global reserve currency. It will be the global reserve currency. It will be how come countries

00:06:34conduct trade

00:06:35between each other, and it will level the playing field.

00:06:39Countries will have to change what they're doing, and this is a good thing. So, anyways,

00:06:44take note of that as you listen to this, but listen to this because this and I hate it when I say this, but sometimes I feel like I have to. This may be one of the most important podcasts that I ever record.

00:06:55I don't wanna be overly dramatic. I'm I'm trying very desperately not to be.

00:07:00But take a listen, and I'll see you at the end.

00:07:03Alright. I wanna get on in today's topic.

00:07:06This has been on my mind lately.

00:07:09Maybe it even started creeping out on the last recording

00:07:12towards the end,

00:07:14but I feel like this is important enough. And maybe since the last time I really talked about this directly,

00:07:21maybe things have solidified a little bit in my

00:07:24my mind.

00:07:26In terms of how as Bitcoiners we

Unknown:00:07:30interact

00:07:31with the world, really, our world view,

00:07:34if you wanna call it that.

00:07:36And actually, I think that's a really good way to put it.

00:07:40Because if you have the wrong world view,

00:07:44you can have wrong results.

00:07:47And unfortunately,

00:07:49I hear

00:07:51people in the Bitcoin space,

00:07:53people who

00:07:55who have some prominence even,

00:07:58who speak things

00:08:01that I don't

00:08:03I wonder where they're coming from.

00:08:06So back

00:08:07in

00:08:08December of last year, 2022,

00:08:10I started a series that lasted for 6 episodes. It was episodes 84 through 89

Unknown:00:08:17of this podcast. So you could go back and take a listen to them if you would like. I would encourage you to do so, to be honest, if you have not, because

00:08:25I'm not going to get into all the ins and outs, the details of Austrian versus Keynesian economics.

00:08:32But ladies and gentlemen, listen to me and listen to me well.

00:08:37The people

00:08:38who are in power in this world, the central bankers who control monetary policy,

00:08:44people like Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen,

00:08:47These fools,

Unknown:00:08:49and I mean

00:08:51exactly what I said. I don't use that word lightly.

00:08:55Because they're either fools or they're power mad,

00:08:58or both.

00:09:00Because

Unknown:00:09:01they are leading,

00:09:03well in that case,

00:09:05the United States

00:09:06to a path of destruction.

00:09:08We are at 33 $1,000,000,000,000

00:09:10$33,000,000,000,000

00:09:12in debt,

00:09:13which is an astonishingly high figure. There's no chance that we will ever

00:09:18pay this back without

00:09:21devaluing

00:09:23the dollar

00:09:24much quicker than it's been devalued over the last

00:09:2893 years,

00:09:30which I think this,

00:09:32yes.

00:09:33No.

00:09:34I can't do math. It's 93%

Unknown:00:09:37since

00:09:381913.

Unknown:00:09:40That's a huge amount.

00:09:42The purchasing power of the dollar has gone down that much. Oh, you know what happened in 1913?

00:09:47The Federal Reserve was was created. I do not think those two things are unrelated.

00:09:53So the goal of the federal reserve is basically to, you know, ensure the stability of the United States economy.

00:10:01And it's basically through good luck

00:10:04and then becoming

00:10:06the world's global reserve currency

00:10:08in the late in the, what, mid midish forties, 19 forties, post World War 2, Bretton Woods agreement,

00:10:16New Hampshire.

00:10:17Nice place if you've ever been there.

00:10:20That is the only reason

00:10:22that we have made it as long as we have.

Unknown:00:10:25That time is coming to an end.

00:10:28One way or the other,

00:10:30the dollar will no longer be the world's global reserve currency.

Unknown:00:10:34And these people who think they can manipulate the economy and keep it in balance

00:10:40forever

00:10:41are wrong, and history proves them wrong over and over again.

00:10:47And the deeper I go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, so to speak, the tireder I get of this.

00:10:53I only have one life to spend.

00:10:57I don't have more than that. And one thing that's become very clear to me over the last few years

00:11:03is that

00:11:05I will be spending a good deal of that time

00:11:08doing what I can.

00:11:10And I'm not equating myself to Paul Revere when I say this, but to be like Paul Revere,

00:11:16running

00:11:18to sound the alarm saying

00:11:21the British are coming in his case.

00:11:23Sorry, Brits.

00:11:26But in I but in this case,

00:11:28we are headed for

00:11:32a global

00:11:33calamity. And I don't I don't I don't wanna be pessimistic. I don't wanna be alarmist,

00:11:39but I don't see how else this happens.

00:11:41You've got Japan, China,

00:11:44United States,

00:11:46European countries,

00:11:47virtually every country well, certainly all of those.

00:11:51I bet every one of the big 20,

00:11:53g 20 is their so called

00:11:56top industrialized countries in the world,

00:11:59are immensely in debt. What happens

00:12:03when that collapses?

00:12:05What happens when China collapses because they can no longer prop up the

00:12:11the the renminbi?

00:12:13What happens to Japan when when they cannot support their 200 plus percent debt

00:12:19on on the, Japanese yen?

00:12:23What happens to the EU when they're

00:12:27so in debt that they can't continue?

00:12:31In the United States, we have a program called Social Security.

00:12:35Basically, you invest in it your entire life, and then at the end, you're supposed to be

00:12:40receive money back from the government. Now first of all, it's a terrible investing plan.

00:12:45You look at the returns on investment,

00:12:47and it stinks.

00:12:49Supposedly, they feel like they have to do this because people won't do it on their own. And maybe they're correct in that,

Unknown:00:12:56but

00:12:58it's a terrible system.

00:13:00And because

00:13:03our birth rate is going down and because

00:13:06of the way that the system is set up,

Unknown:00:13:09we've known for a long time, the end of this system is coming. It will not be sustainable.

00:13:16And that end is in sight.

00:13:18It will happen

00:13:20before I retire.

00:13:22So I will have put in

00:13:25money into this sum 1,000 and 1,000 of tens of 1,000 of dollars.

Unknown:00:13:31I don't know how much.

00:13:33An astonishing amount of money over my lifetime.

Unknown:00:13:38But there's no way I will get one

00:13:41what I'm even supposed to get, which is

00:13:44not

00:13:45considering what I put in, it's not that much.

00:13:49I would I would have done a lot better taking that money

00:13:52and putting it in a stock, mutual fund index, whatever they call it. Not that I'm saying you should do that, but

00:14:00I mean,

00:14:01it's it's astounding how poorly managed that system is.

00:14:05And yet,

00:14:07because of the way that it's set up,

00:14:10it will end.

00:14:12How is that going to

00:14:14help the situation?

00:14:16And, like, right now,

00:14:18in France, they just lowered the retirement a or raise the retirement age.

00:14:23Similar system. Right? You go to whatever age and then you retire and you're gonna get your

00:14:29or what I maybe that's Spanish. I don't know. Anyways, that may not even be correct. I apologize to whoever I just offended.

00:14:36I'm sorry.

00:14:37And so they were literally rioting about this. I don't know if it actually passed or not. I think it did though.

00:14:44I think it was a done deal.

00:14:46So they're screaming because they're raising the retirement age because they can't do well, what happens when there is no retirement? What happens when they raise that age to to 80

00:14:56And and basically people can't even function at that point

00:15:00because they've worked for 65 years.

00:15:04What kind of system is that? Let me circle back though, before I get too much off track.

00:15:10As a Bitcoiner,

00:15:11you need to understand the difference between Keynesian economics and Austrian economics.

00:15:17You need to understand and I think I did a pretty good job of breaking this down. You need to understand sound money

00:15:25versus whatever they call this in Keynesian circles,

00:15:29stable money or, or whatever.

00:15:31Sound money is Bitcoin. Sound money was gold, although gold could be manipulated.

00:15:36And it was, it was de based. They would mix things in with it, or they would shave gold off

00:15:43of the gold pieces essentially

00:15:46so that it can be manipulated. Bitcoin

00:15:48cannot because it's ruled by a set of protocols, a set of

00:15:52programmatic rules that say,

00:15:54when I send this to you, it, it gets there. You can't double spend that. You can't shave any bit of that off. It that's the transaction.

00:16:03So the government cannot manipulate that money supply

00:16:07in a way that's not possible

00:16:10any other way.

00:16:12Keynesian economics says, well,

00:16:14credit's great.

00:16:16GDP,

00:16:17the gross domestic product is the most important metric. It's insanity.

00:16:22Basically, they peg everything on GDP. If your GDP is not growing, well then you're failing.

00:16:28Well, how do we do that? Oh, we print more money. Well, that makes more debt. Well, debt's not a problem. We'll print more money. I mean, their logic is just mind boggling.

00:16:38And yet these people have run this system for a 100 years. Well, Keynes,

00:16:43John Maynard Keynes, the creator of the system,

00:16:47he's not that he or he was he's died.

00:16:51So he was born in 18/83.

00:16:55He died in 1946.

00:16:56Oh, look. He probably got to see the Bretton Woods agreement. I wonder if he was happy about that.

00:17:02So, actually, he would have been old enough. I'm not sure exactly when his ideas started becoming prominent,

00:17:10but it was very early in that mix. I'll I know that. It was

00:17:14prior to, it was certainly prior to World War 2.

00:17:18Probably right around the time of the start of World War 2, I wanna say.

00:17:23It's important to know your enemy, and let me tell you, this is the enemy.

00:17:28And as I say over and over and over and over and unlike

00:17:34Matt O'Dell, and I believe him when he says this, he says, stay humble,

00:17:38humble, stack sats. He has said that that's because he's

00:17:42reminding himself. I'm not reminding myself.

00:17:45I got this drilled into my head. This now staying humble and stacking sats probably is something I need to remind myself of.

00:17:53But successio plebis,

00:17:56this saying that I post on Twitter,

00:17:58and I've said on here before, I've done an entire episode about it.

00:18:02We do not need their systems.

00:18:04And your job as a Bitcoiner is essentially to figure out how you can get out of that system.

Unknown:00:18:11And it may take you a decade.

00:18:15But do you have a better use of your time?

00:18:18Don't buy into

Unknown:00:18:20this fallacy that at the end of your life, you don't have to have anything to pass on to your children.

00:18:25Don't buy into the fallacy that a government has to operate in debt in order to operate.

00:18:31Don't buy into these lies.

00:18:34I guess one of the things that really got me thinking about this was talking to,

00:18:38Jimmy,

00:18:40Jimmy Song,

00:18:41about his book, which we did the interview a couple weeks ago or week or well, I don't know. Time gets all messed up. Week and a half, whatever it was. And he talks about the way that this fiat, which you can just tie right into Keynesian economics.

00:18:56This fiat mindset

00:18:59infects so many things.

00:19:01Things that I didn't even think about are I mean, the economic stuff. Yes. I understood.

00:19:08Some of the other stuff I didn't. I don't have the book here with me, but 31

00:19:12chapters, 31 different things that Fiat corrupts.

00:19:17And it all ties back to this Keynesian economics. This idea that debt doesn't matter. This idea that we have to have a GDP that is continually rising. This idea

00:19:27that the government

00:19:28can run our economies.

00:19:32You don't know the single thing about economics. If you think that a government can run an economies. Economies are complex.

00:19:39You cannot

00:19:40tweak a little thing here, raise the interest rate there, do this, do that,

00:19:45and not expect backlash.

00:19:48But, you know, Jerome Powell just got up a couple days ago and said, yeah, we're gonna, like, we think we're good. We're gonna hold it, and then we're probably gonna raise a little bit towards the end of the year, in the next year. I don't know. We're gonna have a recession in 2027.

00:20:05We're gonna go out back after we get done, print some more money. I'm gonna call up Janet. You know, it's it's insanity.

00:20:13Economies have run

00:20:15for centuries,

00:20:16for centuries, for

00:20:191000 of years,

Unknown:00:20:21ever since,

00:20:24the guy in Turkey.

00:20:27Oh, man.

00:20:29The first guy that created gold coinage.

00:20:32You know,

00:20:33we've been

00:20:36using

00:20:37sound money as a basis for a sound economy,

Unknown:00:20:42and people have flourished. We've had civilizations

00:20:46that have grown and

00:20:48so on and so forth.

00:20:51And as far as I can tell right now, the entire world's fixing to

00:20:55be in a really big mess.

00:20:58And I know this sounds really gloomy,

00:21:01but in my opinion, I'm I'm gonna say this out loud, and I I don't like saying it. I'm very uncomfortable with this, but I also think it's true.

00:21:10One of the ways out for countries,

00:21:13this

00:21:15is is war.

00:21:17Well, we'll just go start a war.

00:21:20I think there are nations, and I'm not gonna say which and it's maybe not even the ones that you're thinking,

Unknown:00:21:25but they have

00:21:27prospered based on war.

00:21:30I don't want that.

00:21:32I don't. I don't want it for me.

00:21:35I don't want it for my children.

Unknown:00:21:37I don't want it for anybody. And I know that we can have a philosophical

00:21:42discussion. Are there times that we should we should fight? Well, maybe. Yes.

00:21:47But I think a lot of wars

00:21:50are over

00:21:51money.

00:21:53You can very easily make the argument about the war in Europe,

00:21:57World War 2, that part of it,

00:21:59being caused because Germany was crushed after World War 1 under debt.

00:22:05We talk about the Weimer Reiner Weimer

00:22:09I may

00:22:11the Weimer

00:22:12maybe it is Weimer Reiner Republic or whatever, where they had I mean, it was hyperinflation.

00:22:19This is where we get the images of wheelbarrows, literal wheelbarrows of money.

00:22:24And that led directly

00:22:26into the rise of Adolf Hitler,

00:22:28which of course led directly

00:22:30into World War 2.

Unknown:00:22:33If that had not been the case,

00:22:36if they were not

00:22:38crushed under this debt

Unknown:00:22:41and experienced this hyperinflation

00:22:43of the German mark,

00:22:47then I don't think World War 2 would have happened. I don't think Adolf would have ever come to power.

00:22:52I think that millions of people would still be alive. Well, not at this point, but

00:22:58would have lived

00:23:00because of that.

00:23:03That's just a simple example.

00:23:06So this is super important to me. So if I ever sound like I'm

00:23:10just

00:23:11going on and on and maybe getting a little upset, this is important. It is super important to me that everybody in the country have access to the same money. The same sound money. In the United States, there are people who benefit far greater from the US money printing

00:23:31than other people. And the people who do are a very small

00:23:35percent. It's called the Cantillon

00:23:38effect.

00:23:39It's based on their proximity to that money printer, essentially.

00:23:43They leverage that and they gain they make immense gains from that.

00:23:48But the poor guy out there doing minimum wage job,

00:23:52whose money is getting deflated or inflated away,

00:23:56they don't, they don't benefit because they don't have investments in stocks and bonds. And,

00:24:03well, these days you probably shouldn't be investing in bonds, but real estate and these kinds the things that benefit from that money printing.

00:24:11That is not fair.

00:24:13That is not fair and it can be solved.

00:24:16Problem solved by moving to a sound money system.

00:24:20In countries like El Salvador,

00:24:22if I am correct,

00:24:24we will see people flourish

00:24:27based on

Unknown:00:24:29a sound money.

00:24:31A money supply that doesn't,

00:24:34you know, deflate 50% overnight.

00:24:38And after 2 years,

00:24:40it sure sounds like the people in El Salvador are embracing Bitcoin. It's not

00:24:46100%,

00:24:48but

00:24:49they are happy

00:24:51and they are, I, it sounds to me like they're doing better.

00:24:56As the country

00:24:59prospers, which I believe that they will, those people will prosper.

Unknown:00:25:04So you could call El Salvador a grand experiment in Austrian economics, except

00:25:09we've got many examples prior to them.

00:25:13So again, going back to what I said.

00:25:15Successio plevis.

00:25:19You can

00:25:20remove yourself

00:25:21from this system. It is entangling.

00:25:24I understand.

00:25:25But

00:25:27it can be done. We are seeing examples of this.

00:25:30People who are on a Bitcoin standard. People who get their job pay in Bitcoin.

00:25:35People who

00:25:36buy stuff in Bitcoin.

00:25:38People who

00:25:39interact with the majority of people in Bitcoin.

00:25:43And there are tools and systems that are being built so that you can convert your Bitcoin to,

00:25:48the US dollar.

Unknown:00:25:50For example,

00:25:51your local currency,

Unknown:00:25:53so that you can interact with those who don't have Bitcoin or choose not to

00:25:58invest in Bitcoin or that kind of thing. So it is possible, and it's going to become more and more possible over the next few

00:26:06years. So

00:26:07start your preparations.

00:26:09Going back to what I was talking about at the very start though.

Unknown:00:26:14Please be careful listening to people in this space.

00:26:19We are not all the same. And I'm not saying they're bad people, but when you start thinking

00:26:25with a Keynesian

00:26:27economics

00:26:29mindset.

Unknown:00:26:30I mean, these people are talking like, like people, like these economists, these, these government officials,

Unknown:00:26:37like they know what they're

00:26:39doing

00:26:40and they don't. They're like kids

00:26:42just wandering around

Unknown:00:26:45acting.

00:26:46They don't know what they're doing.

00:26:48They're not controlling our economy.

00:26:54Well, we gotta get the unemployment rate down. Boy, when we get our unemployment rate down, we'll be in or up. Excuse me.

00:27:03They're mad because the unemployment rate of the United States quote refuse well,

00:27:09it's only like 3.8%

00:27:11or something.

00:27:13Okay. So

00:27:15to to lower inflation, we have to raise unemployment. I mean, what kind of logic is this?

00:27:22Well, we gotta do that so we have a better GDP.

00:27:26Literally all goes back to GDP with these Keynesians.

Unknown:00:27:30Oh, deflation?

00:27:31Terribly bad idea.

00:27:33Now this is something I haven't researched very deeply. I've heard some

00:27:38I've heard some

Unknown:00:27:40discussion about it. I've heard some podcast about it. I've heard some from people who have thought about it. I've got a book on my list, this kind of thing.

00:27:48So I will say this before I say what I'm fixing to say, but think about this intuitively.

00:27:54When I was 12 years old, our family bought the first computer that we owned.

00:27:59And that computer was

00:28:01a decent machine for the time. It probably cost around $1,000

00:28:07Well, now you can buy a machine that's dramatically faster than that machine,

00:28:12for

00:28:14for $20 if you want to buy a Raspberry Pi and kind of cobble it together.

00:28:19You can buy one that's

00:28:22orders of magnitude

00:28:23times

00:28:2410 or whatever

00:28:26faster if you actually spend that $1,000.

00:28:31But why are we so worried about deflation?

00:28:34Why if we can produce food better

00:28:39and we can lower our costs to do that, why is that a bad thing?

00:28:44Oh, because it harvests the GDP.

00:28:46Because,

00:28:47you know,

Unknown:00:28:49I don't know.

00:28:51That's basically their argument.

00:28:54And it's ridiculous.

00:28:56We should,

00:28:58as a society,

Unknown:00:29:01we should be moving forwards in leaps and bounds. We should have

00:29:04abundant power.

00:29:07Power is the source of civilization.

00:29:09Think about

00:29:10it. We have we should have

00:29:12cheap

00:29:13power.

00:29:16And there's many reasons why that is not the case.

00:29:21But a lot of it is governmental

00:29:23mismanagement.

00:29:24A lot of it is a lack of a free market.

00:29:26And again, governmental control and, and manipulation

00:29:31of these things are it's all right down the Keynesian's

00:29:35lane.

00:29:36So it's like they're doing the very things to, to harm our economy,

00:29:41then saying that they're going to manipulate these interest rates and whatever to keep everything in check while we watch unemployment

00:29:48explode upward, while we watch our food prices explode upward, while we get these

00:29:53Paul Krugman,

00:29:55I'll just call him out. Not that he knows who I am one bit. He's a big

00:30:01economist.

00:30:02He's a New York Times opinion columnist. So, you know, he's got a big voice.

00:30:08He goes

00:30:09the other day, well, inflation is

00:30:12how did he word it? I retweeted

00:30:14it. He made it seem to be a big deal that inflation was down just a tiny bit. So like, we went from like 5.8%

00:30:21down to 5.3.

00:30:23Oh, yay. We're winning and blah, blah, blah. I'm like, you do understand that means that year over year that your 5 your $100 bill loses 5 and a half dollars in value.

00:30:35Don't you?

00:30:37I mean, you're this big shot economist.

Unknown:00:30:42Now, I don't think he has to worry about money,

00:30:45so it doesn't impact him.

Unknown:00:30:48But to the again, going back to the personal minimum wage,

00:30:53that

00:30:54hurts.

00:30:55You know what kind of inflation we should be targeting?

00:30:580.

00:30:59Why do they say 3%?

00:31:02That's just completely

00:31:032%. Whatever it was. 2%. Now they're saying we should have 3%.

00:31:09So they're always moving the targets by the way.

00:31:13Why 2%? Well, it was completely made up, but they knew they had to inflate the money supply

00:31:19and that was going to cause inflation.

00:31:21So that's what they did. They said, well, 2% inflation is good. That's going to be our target. No. Our target should be deflation.

00:31:31What happens if we build a fusion reactor and energy suddenly becomes 0.01,

00:31:37dollars or 1¢ a kilowatt hour

00:31:40usage instead of 15¢ like it is in my state.

00:31:44Well, I'm going to benefit. Oh, well, we don't want you saving.

00:31:48See, the Keynesians hate saving. They think, well, what they say is, well, you won't be investing in the economy. They want you spending. They want you buying crap.

00:31:59Excuse me.

00:32:01See, everything about Keynesian economics is diametrically opposed

00:32:06to what it should be. So we need to do everything we can to resist that. And when you listen to people, whether they're in the Bitcoin space or where they're in mainstream well, you can be assured if they're in mainstream,

00:32:21media or whatever, that they're almost assuredly a Keynesian, whether they understand what that means or not. But start picking apart the things that they're saying.

00:32:30Governments can't control economies.

00:32:32Governments flip a couple of little dials, and they think they have some control over it. And they're printing money into oblivion.

00:32:40We're a $1,000,000,000,000

00:32:41in debt more just over the last few months.

Unknown:00:32:46It's insanity.

00:32:49The acceleration that is occurring.

00:32:51The United States will not make it to a $100,000,000,000,000

00:32:54in debt.

00:32:56It will not. It will never happen. I would bet my

Unknown:00:33:01entire life savings on that. I shouldn't say that, but

00:33:05it's not going to happen.

00:33:08Because we will not be anywhere close to that in our GDP.

00:33:12Our interest will be eating us alive.

00:33:16Well, then we'll lower interest rates. Well, then everything else falls apart because

00:33:21again,

00:33:22economies are super complex. Stop acting like you're the wizard of Oz. You're the guy behind

00:33:29the curtain

00:33:31who manipulates

00:33:32the wizard of Oz, and everybody thinks that the wizard of Oz is all wise and powerful instead of it's just somebody behind the curtain.

Unknown:00:33:42All right. I'm done with this. I'm 30 minutes in. That's enough.

00:33:47But again, I

00:33:49implore you,

00:33:51think about what people are saying.

00:33:54It's time to start separating the sheep from the goats

00:33:59to put it in biblical terms.

Unknown:00:34:02And you want to be a sheep, by the way.

Unknown:00:34:05And the sheep understands that

00:34:09Austrian economics

00:34:11should be the basis of our

00:34:13society.

00:34:15And this Keynesian stuff should be rejected

00:34:18outright as garbage.

Unknown:00:34:21And we need to start making our voices known.

00:34:25I do not understand

00:34:27how people in this

00:34:29Bitcoin circles can act like this stuff is okay.

00:34:33It's not. Well, we're just going to kind of swap out Bitcoin.

00:34:36No.

00:34:39Swap out our local currency for Bitcoin. Sorry. That's what I meant to say. No.

Unknown:00:34:45Reject it. Reject it all.

Unknown:00:34:50We need to build the basis on sound money. We need to build the basis on there's business cycles instead of government intervention.

00:34:58We need to build the basis on GDP really doesn't matter that much. We need to build on a basis of debt does matter. You need to eliminate it. If possible, you need to build on the basis of,

00:35:12get out of people's life. How about that?

00:35:15That's what we need to be building on the basis of Not just

00:35:19Bitcoin's a great store of value, Bitcoin can be a sound money.

00:35:24Because it's far deeper than that. Bitcoin is just the thing that has led us down this rabbit hole. Do not forget that.

Unknown:00:35:33Alright.

00:35:35So there we go.

Unknown:00:35:37We're gonna wrap this up by talking with our about our supporters.

00:35:43This is the shorter episode and especially when I'm late to her on Thursday getting the episode out, which I certainly was this week.

00:35:51Technically, I think it actually came out Friday morning early,

00:35:58and that's okay.

00:36:00Our total support this week was 1598

00:36:03sats.

00:36:04The majority of that was streaming. I appreciate that, of course.

00:36:09Always helpful when people are using a podcasting 2.0 app and they click a stream.

00:36:15They stream some sats to the podcaster to support them. If you're receiving value from a podcast, then then, you know, you should be supporting that podcast if they're a value for value podcast.

00:36:28We did have a boost this week from,

00:36:30Jack

00:36:32Sog,

00:36:32j a k s o g. I do not know how they wish to have that pronounced.

00:36:37500 sat boost, no message.

00:36:39I believe that's the first time I've seen them.

00:36:42But I do appreciate them listening

00:36:44and supporting the show.

00:36:47That was, the Bitcoin Basics Nodes on the network

00:36:51episode.

00:36:53So that would be episode 130. So it was 2 episodes back.

00:36:58Well, it was

00:36:59yeah. It was 2 episodes back.

00:37:02So I do appreciate that Jack Sog or however you wish to have that said.

00:37:07Always good to hear from our listeners to have that support come in. I am

00:37:12working very hard to build up

00:37:14a better podcast

00:37:16even today.

00:37:17Well, really right before I recorded

00:37:20tonight,

00:37:21I was working on I'm going to transition my podcast over to Castapod.

00:37:26And there's two reasons for this. One is money.

00:37:29I'm paying $19 a month to my host, and to be honest, I'm I'm it's an expense. And I'm yes. There's an expense to host it myself, but it gives me flexibility.

00:37:40It's it's cheaper than that to be honest.

00:37:45It's about half the price.

00:37:48And I have the ability

00:37:49to maintain that setup.

00:37:51It's non trivial, but,

00:37:53I can do it.

00:37:55And

00:37:56it with cast a pod, they are continually adding the new value for value tags.

00:38:01Unlike my current host, for example, who doesn't even support chapters.

00:38:07So

00:38:08that's going to be happening in the next few weeks.

00:38:11I've got the basics set up. I'm having trouble getting Castapod to talk to Redis,

00:38:17but that's an issue that we will get resolved.

00:38:21Point is, I'm always working on,

00:38:24being a good steward of this podcast really of of doing my best to keep costs down, but also provide the best experience. Once I get moved over, I will immediately

00:38:34start doing chapters

00:38:37on the podcast as I get recorded. I do not know if I will be able to go back.

00:38:41I'm now at a 132 episodes as I record this. That's a lot of episodes to go back and put chapters on.

00:38:49Essentially, because it would require for one thing, it require

00:38:53listening to each one of those episodes again.

00:38:56And that's a lot of time.

00:38:59A 100 and well, probably over a 130

00:39:02hours.

00:39:04Most episodes are running around a 100,

00:39:08around an hour, around 60 minutes or so.

00:39:12So, anyways,

00:39:14that's what's going on there. We've got news.

00:39:17One bit of news

00:39:19is

00:39:20that

00:39:21Niger and France, I guess, have come to some kind of agreement,

00:39:25I believe, with a fair amount of threats from Niger.

00:39:29France will be leaving the Niger,

00:39:31and,

00:39:33both their military

00:39:34and the ambassador

00:39:36by the end of the year.

00:39:37So in my mind,

00:39:39I'm not going to,

00:39:41you know, these people who are who are doing this, they're called rebels.

00:39:45It's the typical

00:39:47media

00:39:48whitewash

00:39:49portrayal

00:39:49of what's going on. Nobody talks about how France has,

00:39:54profited

00:39:55from this for decades

00:39:58and why they might possibly be a little upset about that.

00:40:02They being

00:40:03Niger.

00:40:05The new leader of Niger, we it remains to be seen, you know, what they're really like on the world stage, so to speak.

00:40:14But in my mind,

00:40:15and until proven otherwise,

00:40:17the people of Niger have at least gained a little self sovereignty. They are now their own country.

00:40:22They are not some puppet

00:40:25of

00:40:26France.

00:40:27And I man, that sounds terrible saying that, but it really is the truth. And I've

00:40:33gone through that,

00:40:36had a couple of episodes about the CFA, about what France has done in the past,

00:40:41and continues to do so.

00:40:44And these African countries are starting to push back on that. So

00:40:48we will see how that turns out, but don't

00:40:54believe what you hear if they're saying that this

00:40:57this is about France and France leaving the Niger. The plain and simple. That's what it's about.

Unknown:00:41:04And removing the person in power

00:41:07who

00:41:08was a puppet of France.

Unknown:00:41:11So I do wish them the best of luck. I hope that turns out for them. Hey, they should check out Bitcoin

00:41:16as a nice,

00:41:18legal tender instead of the CFA, if that's what they had, which I believe it is.

00:41:25I think you should whatever

00:41:28resources

00:41:29that Niger has, and I do not know offhand,

00:41:32they should start developing those themselves.

00:41:35If they can mine bauxite for example.

00:41:39Smelt that, turn it into aluminum and ship aluminum. Don't take that bauxite and send it off to France or some other country to have them turn it into aluminum and then, you know, up charge it a 100 x.

00:41:52So

00:41:53make that money yourself,

00:41:55people of Niger.

00:41:58Now, that's just my little opinion,

00:42:00and I do not live in Africa.

00:42:03I don't have any real contacts in Africa.

00:42:06So that's just my perception.

00:42:09And my biased perception, to be honest. So take that with a grain of salt. Generation

00:42:15Bitcoin supports podcasting 2 point o. It is a value for value podcast, as I mentioned earlier,

00:42:21with no sponsors and no advertising. You will never hear Ledger jump in in the middle of all this and say,

00:42:27or me do a host read for Ledger saying, you know, you should use a Ledger and blah, blah, blah. No. Actually, you shouldn't because Ledger,

00:42:34has leaked your information.

00:42:36Ledger, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe it was one of the other hardware wallets. I believe it was Ledger.

00:42:42Ledger certainly has this lovely new feature where they touted as being this multi sig setup so that, you know, we've got 2 of your keys and you've got 1. And that way, if you lose your key, you can recover your

00:42:56Bitcoin. Well,

00:42:58maybe you should be more responsible with your keys, have multiple copies,

00:43:03multiple different kinds, have one on paper, have one on metal maybe,

00:43:09or one with a lawyer or one in a safe deposit box and one at home.

00:43:13I don't know.

00:43:14Be smart. Don't depend on somebody else to manage that. And the whole thing has really kinda turned into a big fiasco. In fact, I think the CTO just left.

00:43:25I don't really kinda report on that kinda news because it's

00:43:29almost like gossip, but, yeah, I think so.

00:43:33I think those two things are related, by the way.

00:43:37Anyways,

00:43:38you can support this podcast in 3 different ways because I am looking to build this out and it does require

00:43:44money.

00:43:46Hosting costs money.

00:43:48You know, I would.

00:43:51There's so many different ways that we could build this out.

00:43:54Anyways, that does require money for one thing. That's treasure. But there's 2 other things really,

00:43:59time and talent,

00:44:01that can be just as important.

00:44:03I always appreciate people as they listen, as they stream, as they boost.

00:44:08That helps the show. I could use some help with, like, transcripts. I could use some help with maybe work on the website, which is it's always

00:44:16always behind

00:44:18because it's just not,

00:44:20there's just not enough time. I'm recording this twice a week. I'm doing the

00:44:25the research,

00:44:26the putting together of all the stuff. It takes me several hours just to record, put it out, and get the website

00:44:32updated even just a little bit.

00:44:35All of that.

00:44:36And, yes, I have a day job which consumes a lot of my time to support my family, frankly, because it certainly wouldn't happen on this. And and and that's okay. I don't want it to. That's not what I'm looking for, but

00:44:49it would be nice to grow this out. So if you find the content valuable, you can support the podcast by streaming stats or boosting from a podcasting 2.0 app. You can get those apps,

00:45:01at podcastapps.com.

00:45:03If you'd like the content, I would love it if you would tell your friends about Generation Bitcoin podcast. That is the single

00:45:10best way for us to spread the word about Generation Bitcoin.

00:45:14Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful, and I would love to hear from you. I'm on Twitter at Macintosh Fintech. Although, I will not stay on Twitter after they start charging everyone, which is apparently what's going to happen.

00:45:27I will not pay to post on Twitter. I'm not going to do that. I'm also on mastodon@macintosh@podcastindex.social.

00:45:35I'm also on nostr. I have that pubkey

00:45:38from nostr

00:45:40pinned, I think, or at least in my profile

00:45:43on Twitter, if you would like to get that.

00:45:47I can be reached by email, macintosh@gentashbtc.com.

00:45:51Stay humble friends. Go out. Make it a great week. I'll talk to y'all soon.
