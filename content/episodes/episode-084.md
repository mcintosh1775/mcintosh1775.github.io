There are two main theories of macro economics - Austrian and Keynesian. Austrian economics developed in the late 1800's Austria while Keynesian economics was developed in the environment of the 1930's Great Depression.

I believe that it's pretty indisputable that the majority of the countries of the world operate under what amounts to Keynesian economics. I believe that these policies are what are bringing us to the brink of a Global Depression.

In today's episode I give an overview of the two economic theories, a bit of history and the major differences between them.
