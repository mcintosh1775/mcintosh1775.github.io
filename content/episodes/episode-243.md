This week Macintosh and Kenshin break down Bitcoin multisig: what it is, why it exists, and how it reduces single points of failure in self-custody. They walk through common setups (1-of-2, 2-of-2, 2-of-3, 3-of-5), why complexity is both a feature and a risk, and best practices like geographic distribution, avoiding single-vendor signer risk, and testing recovery before you commit meaningful funds.

The guys also touch on the rise of AI “agent” tooling (and why you should be careful with security/permissions), then close with market/news items including Helix mixer seizure headlines, state-level Bitcoin reserve chatter, current BTC price levels, and mining stats (difficulty adjustment / blocks behind).
