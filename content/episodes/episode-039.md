Last episode we discussed how to earn interest on your crypto using centralized platform such as [https://nexo.io](https://nexo.io). Crypto being crypto, there are decentralized methods to earning interest -- called "yield farming". Cutting out the middleman can provide a much higher return on your assets but there are risks we need to discuss.

During today's episode we cover the various ways that defi platforms can provide services that allow you generate that interest. I discuss the four primary ways that interest can be earned on these platforms. And of course we talk about risks of using a decentralized platform.
