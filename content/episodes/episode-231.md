In this episode, McIntosh and Kenshin have an honest conversation about the podcast's sustainability and future direction. After over four years of producing content, they discuss the challenges of maintaining a value-for-value podcast and share their plans to improve the show through better audio quality, enhanced content, and potentially bringing in sponsors while maintaining their ethical standards.

The hosts outline their timeline and goals for growth, ask for listener feedback on proposed improvements, and emphasize their commitment to serving the Bitcoin community. They also cover the current Bitcoin price sitting at $106,885 and revisit the discussion about market cycles and potential patterns that may indicate where we are in the current cycle.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “The Jetsons” by Joe Martin.
