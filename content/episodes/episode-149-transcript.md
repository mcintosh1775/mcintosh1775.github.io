McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, Pleb Nation. Today is January 1st, and this is episode 149

00:00:05of Satoshi's

00:00:06Plebs.

00:00:07I'm your host, McIntosh, and today's episode will be

00:00:10a year in review plus what is coming in 2024.

00:00:45Alright.

00:00:46Happy

00:00:47New Year.

00:00:48I hope everyone has had a great holiday.

00:00:53I did, of course, take some time off. This will be the 1st episode in 1 month.

00:00:59And as I posted somewhere, I think on Twitter, I did miss it, to be honest.

00:01:04I did.

00:01:06I've been doing this for two and a half years at this point,

00:01:10for a good portion of that time twice a week.

00:01:13And you get in this rhythm, and then it's like, oh, wait. The rhythm's gone. But

00:01:19I would say that I spent a bunch of time resting and,

00:01:23You know,

00:01:24reenergizing.

00:01:25But the reality is is that,

00:01:27I spent a bunch of time building,

00:01:29and we'll be discussing that,

00:01:32in a few minutes,

00:01:34about what I've been doing for the last month. Because even though I wasn't recording, I spent a good bit of time building

00:01:40infrastructure

00:01:41For Satoshi's Plebs and

00:01:44laying things out, trying to figure out what I was gonna change, and not everything's in place.

00:01:50For example, I just played the music,

00:01:52same music as I've been playing for a long time. That's going to change. I have not Found new music yet. I was looking for value for value music that I could,

00:02:01include in the splits,

00:02:04and

00:02:06I haven't been able to do that yet, so I spent about an hour kind of poking around. I haven't really found anything. I don't know if I've ever told you all this.

00:02:15I may have, but,

00:02:17I am very eclectic, if you wanna call it that, in my musical taste. I can basically listen to anything,

00:02:24outside of rap and

00:02:26opera. I don't like opera. I can even listen to classical music to an extent.

00:02:32Regardless, I haven't found anything yet.

00:02:35I hope before the next episode that that is taken care of.

00:02:38But it is New Year's Eve. It's 1:20

00:02:41in the afternoon as I record. I will post this tomorrow morning,

00:02:46New Year's Day

00:02:48on our regular schedule, Monday mornings.

00:02:51But I did wanna take a time to,

00:02:54I did wanna kinda take This episode and kind of review, I'm not really gonna go over the news of the last month. There's been a bit. I will touch on it.

00:03:03A lot of, you know, fluff, whatever.

00:03:06But,

00:03:07I did wanna go over kind of the year because it's it's been a long year for a lot of us, and

00:03:13It's always good to look back and kinda see where we came from. Some of this is,

00:03:19podcast specific for for this podcast. Some of it is,

00:03:23After we get done with that, we'll turn more towards kind of the Bitcoin world.

00:03:29And, so we'll just jump right on into that. So for this year, I pulled up some statistics.

00:03:36I recorded 57 episodes, so

00:03:39that's a little more than 1 per week.

00:03:41I did not record,

00:03:442 episodes

00:03:45a week all year long. Of course, I took the month of December off, so,

00:03:50I would like to see that be a little more towards a 100

00:03:53than 57

00:03:55next year,

00:03:56but

00:03:58Overall, I think pretty good.

00:04:00One of the things that they said to build

00:04:03to build a solid listenership for your podcast is, of course, to be regular, and

00:04:07Tried, frankly, very hard to do that. I've not always been successful.

00:04:12Sometimes, especially on the Thursday episodes,

00:04:15work will interfere.

00:04:17But,

00:04:18we do the best we can,

00:04:20and we're gonna continue to try and improve on that. So 57 episodes.

00:04:24Our total boost in stream. So, of course, we're a value for value podcast. I strongly support what's going on with the podcasting 2 point o movement, if you wanna call it that.

00:04:35We kind of congregate over at the Mastodon

00:04:38podcast index dot social

00:04:41instance for our Interactions,

00:04:45the two kind of co leaders of that, Adam Curry, Dave.

00:04:50I actually don't know Dave's Last name offhand. I should. But, anyways, they host the podcast. They put it out every week,

00:04:57and it's about developments

00:04:59In the podcasting world, we are incorporating

00:05:03a huge number of changes

00:05:06that are, In my opinion,

00:05:08very much improving podcast, making it better things like transcripts,

00:05:13chapters,

00:05:14the ability to stream payments to a podcast,

00:05:18The ability to send boost and messages,

00:05:22this type thing. We're talking about some very interesting things about,

00:05:26Cross app comments right now. Probably, it sounds like they're steering towards using the activity pub

00:05:33Protocol to to

00:05:35basically

00:05:36allow for that between the applications. It sounds like a a really brilliant

00:05:41solution.

00:05:43That work is ongoing, so you can jump into that at new podcast apps.com

00:05:47if you would like and get a podcast two point o app.

00:05:51Like I mentioned, there's the podcast index dot social mastodon

00:05:56instance. You're welcome to join in there.

00:05:59And

00:06:00a lot of that Content is about podcasting.

00:06:03Not all of it, of course, because people are free to post whatever they want,

00:06:07but there's a lot of information there.

00:06:11So would love to see some of the listeners on there, interact with them. Let me know if you,

00:06:16jump on there. I'm McIntosh at podcastindex.social

00:06:19on there. So this year, we had a total boost in streams, and I did not break it down. Both are equally important. I do not know,

00:06:28Honestly, what the ratio is because

00:06:30I'm just using the data that's given to me by Satoshis stream.

00:06:35And that was

00:06:37343,408

00:06:39sats, and that's after

00:06:41basically, they take 10% of that. So it would actually be more like 370 if I'm not mistaken, 375,

00:06:47something like that. That converts to about $145.15

00:06:51at the current rate.

00:06:53I have not touched that money. It's still sitting in there. And to be honest, I don't really intend to. I'm a let it build up. I will eventually be putting it on a lightning node.

00:07:03In fact, I hope to do that very soon in the next month or so

00:07:07and use that as liquidity,

00:07:09to start routing to be able to accept my own payments so that I don't have to use to to stream.

00:07:15Not that they're a bad service,

00:07:17but I wanna do it myself. I'm kind of a DIY guy,

00:07:20and,

00:07:21I like doing it myself. Plus, that'll save me about 10%.

00:07:25So always good for a or maybe it's 1%.

00:07:29Let's see.

00:07:30I don't know. I think it's 1%, actually.

00:07:33So my calculation I just did was all off. So I apologize, but I think you get the idea.

00:07:40So

00:07:4157 episodes. What else did I do this year specific about this podcast? I'm not gonna talk about the topics we covered.

00:07:49I have a page, by the way.

00:07:52If you go to satoshis-pebs.com,

00:07:54,

00:07:55which is our new website,

00:07:58there's a link to it. It's called, like, episode library. It's right on the top. You can click on that, and then it is actually current right now.

00:08:06Episodes 1 through 148.

00:08:10Back when we were,

00:08:12generation wealth through cryptocurrency

00:08:14and then,

00:08:16Generation Bitcoin.

00:08:17All of those episodes are listed there with the main topic.

00:08:21Feel free to browse through that. You can actually,

00:08:26Well, just feel free to browse. You can take a look at that. Those episodes are all still available

00:08:31in the same feed, by the way.

00:08:34So what did I do? I moved the podcast from Captivate, which is a podcast host,

00:08:39to Castapod,

00:08:40so I am now Self hosting it. I just did that.

00:08:44I started work on it about a month and a half. I actually made the flip about

00:08:492 days ago maybe. I kinda waited till there was the the least amount of traffic in case there was any issues, which there were not. It was a very easy process. Castapod itself, this is my 2nd podcast setting it up on Castapod. I

00:09:05Basically, edited another podcast,

00:09:08that

00:09:09my family was involved in,

00:09:11for a couple of years.

00:09:13There was some overlap there, but, you know, couple years before this.

00:09:18And so we had already moved that one. I kinda learned the ropes on that. Castapod,

00:09:23is some it's PHP

00:09:25based software,

00:09:27and it's self hosting.

00:09:30So my files sit there,

00:09:33all the content sits there,

00:09:37everything. And once you kind of learn a few things, it's It's the I will say this. Well, it was not perfect. However,

00:09:46there was a very good Discord group,

00:09:48A very active Discord group that was very helpful

00:09:52sorting through some issues. So I would encourage people,

00:09:55If you're hosting a podcast or if you have your podcast in, there's 2 reasons to do this. 1, money. So I Self host on Hetz Hetzner. It's a German company, actually.

00:10:07They do VPS,

00:10:09virtual private servers.

00:10:11Very nice company. I've had zero issues with them. I actually host my servers

00:10:16in Germany, and the reasons why I do that, that is the only place that they have,

00:10:21ARM chipset servers. So rather than Intel or AMD, they're actually, ARM chips,

00:10:28which I really like. They're a little cheaper. They're, more power efficient,

00:10:33but they only host those in Germany. You can if you're in the United States, you can use servers here in the United States that are

00:10:41Intel or, AMD chip servers.

00:10:45If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it,

00:10:48but whatever.

00:10:51I'm spending

00:10:52$3 a month now on the server that runs those, and I could have multiple

00:10:57podcast. In fact,

00:11:01so

00:11:02Very, very economical. I was paying $15 a month at Captivate. I have no problem with Captivate, by the way, other than the fact that they are Slow to put on podcasting 2 point o tags,

00:11:14but their service was always good, but it's $15 a month. So now I just save myself $12 a month

00:11:20and Castapod

00:11:22adds tags very, very frequently.

00:11:24Alright. So anyways, we moved from Captivate to Castapod.

00:11:28I'm now self hosting that. I set up a new website. I already mentioned it. Satoshisplebs.com. satoshis-plebs.com

00:11:37,

00:11:38of course, it looks very much like my old site. It will probably change over the next few months. I set Up a Bitcoin note, this is something I would encourage anyone to do.

00:11:48Just just set up a Bitcoin node. Watch the transactions going through it.

00:11:53It's fascinating, and there are things that you can do with that. In this case, this is more for just testing and it's just gonna sit out there.

00:12:01I'll get to that in just a minute,

00:12:02but there you go. We've got a note set up. I set up hedge doc for note taking. I'm actually using that right now. This is something

00:12:10When I lost my Umbrel

00:12:12when was that back in November?

00:12:14I had been using one of the

00:12:17programs that,

00:12:19Umbral supplies and, trillium. That was the name of the program, and it worked fine.

00:12:24But I

00:12:25When I moved to Hetzner for all of my different services, and I counted it up. I have, like, a dozen things up there right now. Kinda crazy.

00:12:34But,

00:12:35anyways, I decided to test out Hedgehog, and I've been pretty pleased with it. It's an online note taking service.

00:12:41I could actually make these notes public,

00:12:44so I could send anybody

00:12:46to the website

00:12:48and they could see it, or private. So most of my notes I think I have 1 public note. It's some links, and I'll add more links to there, and I'll eventually

00:12:56Make that available either directly on Hedgehog or on the Satoshi Plebs website,

00:13:02that kind of thing. It's,

00:13:04can be done in markdown, which I like. It's a,

00:13:07markup language,

00:13:09like XML.

00:13:11It's a version of that.

00:13:13So very flexible. Anyways,

00:13:16what else? Set up a,

00:13:18it's an SMP server. So it's called it's basically Simple X. So if you've ever heard a Simple X, it's a

00:13:25it's a secure way of communicating.

00:13:28Now my initial thought with this, and it's open source. They make everything available,

00:13:33which is very important to me for something like this. They make everything available as code up on GitHub or GitLab. I'm not sure which. But I set up a server as a test kit, as a test bed, and then I ended up Setting it up for my own use. So my family will actually use this to communicate ultimately between each other

00:13:53rather than using, say, Facebook Messenger. We You may say Macintosh, you're being paranoid. Maybe I am.

00:13:59But, I would rather control this myself. Plus, it is end to end encrypted.

00:14:04There's a lot of really nice things about simplex, and I really intended to do this as a chatroom

00:14:12For

00:14:14Satoshi's Plebs,

00:14:15unfortunately,

00:14:16one thing it doesn't do very well, there's two issues. It's a little laggy

00:14:21because of the encryption.

00:14:22And it doesn't really handle, like, community,

00:14:26like, group things. There is

00:14:29You can,

00:14:31but, basically, they say if you get above about 50 people, which maybe I don't ever reach, but

00:14:38In the chat room at one time,

00:14:40it kind of implodes. So I wanted to steer away from that. I ended up going, with an IRC server setup,

00:14:48which I am building now.

00:14:51It's not quite done yet.

00:14:53Basically, on the suggestion of some people over at podcasting 2.0 that I was talking about earlier.

00:15:00So that's not done yet, but when that is done, it's about 75% done probably.

00:15:06When that's done, then that will actually be available for the plebs,

00:15:12to use as kind of a chat room. And one of the big reasons we'll do that is because during 2024,

00:15:19Not to jump ahead, but I do wanna start doing a live stream.

00:15:23My plan is for Sunday nights, and

00:15:26This will not be happening until I'm ready. So it may be several months or more, so don't

00:15:32get too excited. But on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, Thursdays will be reserved for

00:15:38interviews that I have with people, that kind of thing. That will not be at a fixed time.

00:15:44Alright. So,

00:15:45we'll do live on Sunday night and then Monday morning at 7 o'clock. As always, they will come out.

00:15:52But I wanted to have a chat room for that. That's where we were going with all that. That's where the IRC comes in. So I'm almost done with that. Set up activity pub for Satoshi's Plebs site. So

00:16:03there was a new plugin that came out, I think, in September for WordPress, which is what I use for

00:16:08Satoshi's Plebs just because I've done WordPress forever,

00:16:13and it's easy.

00:16:15But it will allow me to federate my post,

00:16:18which I'm pretty pumped about. So, essentially, it will look like I have a mastodon instance. And when I post on the website, which I will We'll be planning to do more during 2024.

00:16:29That will go right into the feed. And then if you're into Mastodon,

00:16:34you can subscribe to that And see those as they get published.

00:16:40What else did we do? Tested out the seed signer hardware wallet. I am convinced at this point that seed signer is the best hardware

00:16:48wallet that's out there.

00:16:50Of course, I've had seed signer on the program.

00:16:52When he was on the program, I had not picked up 1 yet. I had already, of course, been interested in it at that point. I have thoroughly tested it out. I'm very happy with it. My only complaint, and I do intend to put this on their Discord, and it's not really something that's fixable.

00:17:09One thing I don't really talk about, I have a a fair amount of issues

00:17:15with my eyes.

00:17:17I've worn glasses forever,

00:17:19and I actually found out not too long ago I have cataracts.

00:17:23Very early stage, but I have eye issues is really what it amounts to.

00:17:29And the screen on the seed signer is very, very tiny, and that's partially what helps keep the cost down.

00:17:36But it's also very hard for me to kinda work around. The screen is not terrible.

00:17:44I wouldn't rather have

00:17:45Easily, I don't know, double, triple, quadruple the size of what it is.

00:17:50But

00:17:51the QR code thing that you fill out paper,

00:17:55Stock paper.

00:17:57Extremely difficult for me.

00:17:59I was able to do it the second time I did it. The first time, it did not work at all.

00:18:05It's just the dots are so small.

00:18:07It's just I don't know.

00:18:10Not really a complaint.

00:18:12It's just the reality.

00:18:15Maybe not ideal for for people who have

00:18:19vision issues, but

00:18:20Basically, any of I mean, the ledger one's even smaller, to be honest. I've told you all in the past. I have ledger, which I do,

00:18:28which I will be moving off of on the seed center, but, you know,

00:18:33that screen's even smaller.

00:18:34So there you go. That's literally my only complaint.

00:18:38So good good job testing that out. I enjoyed it, learned a bit, all that kind of stuff.

00:18:45And then the last thing,

00:18:47a couple of weeks ago, like, the middle of the month, I did order a new computer.

McIntosh:00:18:53I've been looking into this for a long time. I've I've had the one picked out

00:18:58since middle of the year.

McIntosh:00:19:01And, essentially, I managed to pull together the money to to get it ordered. It's a Beelink

00:19:07GTR 7 Pro.

00:19:09So what that means is I'll be moving from a Mac mini,

00:19:14that's about 10 years old

00:19:16to a computer that'll hold up to 64 gigs. It'll come with 32,

00:19:20and

00:19:22I think it's four cores.

00:19:25It's an AMD chip. I think it's like sixteen

00:19:30or maybe it's sixteen cores.

00:19:33I'm not quite sure, but it's a lot bigger than this one.

00:19:38And I think a terabyte or maybe two terabytes

00:19:41of hard drive. It's supposed to be here

00:19:44the fourth,

00:19:45which is, like, next Thursday. The reality is it hasn't shipped according to their Thing,

00:19:51I don't think it's gonna make it by then, but I'm hoping for it very soon. I will be setting NextOS

00:19:57Up on it is my plan. I've played around with that a little bit. It's a Linux distribution that

00:20:03it's pretty cool,

00:20:04and I'm looking forward to using it. So if I can't get that to work, which I'm not 100% sure that I'll be able to do everything I need to do on it, then I'll use Ubuntu, which is another Linux distribution

00:20:16that I've probably been using for 10 years or more.

00:20:20So what are we gonna do in 2024?

00:20:23Let me run through this list really quick.

00:20:27Some of these are goals. I'll probably move the goals. I think some of these are set into stone at this point.

00:20:34I do wanna install an Electrum server. This is not something I've talked about. Maybe I'll I should take an episode to talk about this. I'll probably do it after I do

00:20:43which will be basically as soon as I get my computer.

00:20:48Electrum is basically a modified form of a Bitcoin node, and it interacts with that Bitcoin node, you have to have both. So I'm gonna set up a full Bitcoin node on my new computer. I'm gonna set up Electrum.

00:21:00I'll also set up reaper, which is what I use for the audio stuff, and then use that

00:21:07to handle,

00:21:09essentially, my seed signer wallet.

00:21:11So I'll talk about all that after I get it set up, but that's certainly one goal.

00:21:17I'm going to go to the Bitcoin conference in Nashville that is in July 25 to 27.

00:21:24Nashville is in the southeastern part of the United States. It's a very nice city, actually. I've spent a little bit of time there. I'm looking forward to that. What I'm really looking forward to is meeting some of

00:21:35my my friends, some of the people that I've interviewed, some of the people like

00:21:40Mere Mortals and hopefully some of the listeners as well.

00:21:44Kyrin, better go now. I know you're not sure if you're going, but you need to go, buddy.

00:21:50Anyways,

00:21:52really looking forward to that. I will set up a live stream this year. I don't know exact or next year. This year, by the time you get this, I

00:22:00don't know exactly when, like I said, but hopefully, maybe Q1.

00:22:04I'm also gonna be providing a video version of podcast. And this is something I've gone back and forth on, but I'm pretty solid at this point. Now that probably will be second half. It would definitely be

00:22:15After setting up the livestream, I wanna get that going first.

00:22:20Why do you say that, why a video podcast? Because I like them, frankly.

00:22:24A lot of people don't, but I do think there's benefit to that for things like this Electrum server that I was just talking about. It would be Very helpful

00:22:34to show that to

00:22:36the listeners, to the viewers, kind of how that works rather than just talking about it.

McIntosh:00:22:39kind of how that works rather than just talking about it.

McIntosh:00:22:43That would be an excellent example right there. I'm gonna host the video up on YouTube, and you may say, gosh, Macintosh, I can't believe you just said that.

00:22:52But for one thing, there won't be any ads. I'm not looking to monetize it on there because I do believe in value for value rather than Shoving ads in your face like what they do on YouTube,

00:23:03but it's free.

00:23:05And

00:23:06With the podcasting 2 point o spec, you can literally just point to that video,

00:23:12and

00:23:13it will

00:23:14show up

00:23:16as a

00:23:18as a source. Now I will also be keeping a set of my video. I don't trust They could take me down for any reason, and I will not self censor

00:23:28just to keep on video on YouTube.

00:23:31So at some point, when I say something that they don't believe in and they take me down, well, then I'll just point to a new source,

00:23:38which would be my own host. And

00:23:40The thing is that's going to cost money,

00:23:43so I don't wanna jump right into that

00:23:46at this point because we're not making a whole lot. So

00:23:50We're not making enough to cover that is a reality,

00:23:53and it would immediately start coming out of my pocket.

00:23:57I have two goals,

00:23:59in terms of metrics for the podcast, I want to quadruple my listenership. I will tell y'all right now, I'm at around 1800 downloads

00:24:07a month.

00:24:09I will be able to keep better track of that with castapod

00:24:12than I did with Captivate,

00:24:14but that's roughly what I was doing for the last four or five months. It's slowly growing. Although, of course, in December, I took a nose dive. I only had 500 downloads in December,

00:24:24but, but that's okay.

00:24:26There was no content.

00:24:29So I wanna quadruple that. So we're looking at,

00:24:33you know, roughly 8,000 downloads a month or so. I would love to do more. I think that's very realistic, especially as we come into this bull market, which is cranking up. I haven't even talked about Bitcoin

00:24:46In terms of that, maybe I should do that before we roll into everything else. I will. Actually, I've got it right there on my notes. I firmly believe that 2024,

00:24:55Bitcoin will be moving up, not down. So, anyways, that's going to

00:25:01most likely

00:25:02be steering people our way. I've also decided to go ahead and do another promotional with Fountain

00:25:08just to expose more people to the podcast. So I've already talked to Oscar

00:25:13about that, and I'm planning on do that very early,

00:25:17probably January

00:25:18of of 2024.

00:25:21And that should help. We saw that last time we, of course, had a huge spike when we did it, but then more people a number of people stayed around after

McIntosh:00:25:29after

McIntosh:00:25:30the promotion that I did a long time ago now at this point.

00:25:34And then the other thing is, and I've mentioned this as a goal in the past,

00:25:39but for 2024, I really do want to

00:25:42have a goal of about 200,000

00:25:45sats per month of support. That's about $50. It's probably a little more now, but it's about $50 a month.

00:25:52That's 50,000 sats a week. That's 25,000

McIntosh:00:25:55sats an episode if I'm doing two episodes a

00:25:59week. And that is support that's coming from the listeners

00:26:02with value for value as we talk about. So

McIntosh:00:26:05what that means is that essentially stuff that I'm doing out of pocket, I don't so much have to worry about that anymore if I choose to pull that money out. Now I told you I'm putting it into

00:26:16liquidity for a lightning note.

00:26:19But if I'm making, you know, 200,000

00:26:21sats a month, I will probably start pulling out some of that. And there's other things now that I've got my computer on the way.

00:26:28Of course, I want a new microphone. Oh, you know?

00:26:31Actually, my my next 2 big things would be, I need to get a mixer board. I think I need to do that

00:26:39to do live. I may be mistaken. It certainly would make it easier.

00:26:41I wanna get a Rodecaster Pro 2,

00:26:43and then I do wanna upgrade my mic. My mic is old.

00:26:46Not that it's well, old isn't really a big deal, but it's pretty low quality. I think I could do a lot better,

00:26:54and it would sound better.

00:26:56So there we go.

00:26:58That's my goals for 2024. Let's talk about Bitcoin for just a second. It had an interesting year.

00:27:07January 1, 2023,

00:27:09it closed at $16,125.10.

00:27:14Do you even remember that? I do. I was stacking sats. I also encouraged you to do the same thing. I hope you

00:27:22did because those sats have now almost tripled in value.

00:27:26December 31, today 2023,

00:27:29Time of recording, which is now 149 in the afternoon,

00:27:34CST,

00:27:36US.

00:27:37We are at 42,639.

00:27:41I will jot that down right now.

00:27:46So like I said,

00:27:48we have almost tripled

00:27:49in value

00:27:50during the year.

00:27:53Basically, we've seen a steady

00:27:55increase across the year. It's been kind of crazy

00:27:58where we go up and then we level off for a little bit, and then we go up. I I didn't bring up trading view, which I have right here, but,

00:28:08I mean, really,

00:28:09that's kind of what it's been. We we did go sideways.

00:28:13Okay. So here we go.

00:28:15Let's just go ahead,

00:28:17See how Macintosh

00:28:19did.

00:28:21Yep. There's 2023

00:28:23right there. So we went

00:28:25from basically the bottom in 22 in January 1 right there,

00:28:30all the way up to

00:28:32April 11, we hit 31,000.

00:28:35We did go sideways, basically,

00:28:37between April

00:28:39and when we have that breakout, October 23. So that was kind of our grind, and you guys remember that. It hasn't been that long, but we just kinda we ground down, then back up. We were in that parallel channel

00:28:51for months,

00:28:53and then we jumped out of it when we broke free. We've gone from there up to 44700

00:29:00or So

00:29:02and we've kinda been waiting. And what are we waiting for? In my opinion,

00:29:07we're waiting for these

00:29:10ETFs to be approved. This is the one bit of news I did wanna talk about. There's been a fair amount of Activity on that front during January or during December.

00:29:20It does look like those will be approved maybe as early as

00:29:26The next, like, let's see, Tuesday, Wednesday,

00:29:29so 2nd 3rd,

00:29:31the FCC may come out and say, you know, To all these companies or at least the majority of them, you're ready to go. You can go next week. So, like,

00:29:42Literally, January 7 or so,

00:29:45we may see those go live.

00:29:48I certainly think it's going to happen in January. I'm willing to say that at this point.

00:29:54All signs point to that.

00:29:56When that happens,

00:29:58I do believe we'll see Bitcoin probably spike up to about $50,000.

00:30:03Now

00:30:04it may be more.

00:30:06I'm fairly confident we'll at least

00:30:09kind of touch that even if we fall back down.

00:30:14I actually don't have anything charted above where we're at at

00:30:18448 or whatever,

00:30:21that last line of resistance that we hit. So I'm not willing to do anything other than say, well, $50,000

00:30:27is a nice round number,

00:30:29which it is.

00:30:31We may spike right on past that, and we'll see where we go.

00:30:35I do believe,

00:30:37I'm jumping ahead in my notes. I'm not even looking at them.

00:30:41Alright. We'll get to that in a minute. Hash rate.

00:30:46Well, no. I I'll just go ahead and make that.

00:30:49Yeah. No. I've got I'll talk about I've let me stop. Let me stop.

00:30:53Anyways, that ETF news is very important,

00:30:57not because we need e ETFs, and I think I've made that very clear. But what it does is, You know, we gain acceptance.

00:31:05This is Wall Street coming into Bitcoin land,

00:31:08and we will see a surge in investment.

00:31:13I don't have the figures in front of me,

00:31:15but the amount of money that

00:31:18it could be quite large.

00:31:20So we will see how that works out.

00:31:23I'm very, very interested about that because

00:31:27In a sense, not that Bitcoin needs legitimizing,

00:31:30but it legitimizes

00:31:31Bitcoin. At least it does to Wall Street.

00:31:35Now Wall Street can kiss my rear end, but

00:31:39but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is for everybody. I'd say this over and over.

00:31:44And so it's it's for Wall Street too. Now

McIntosh:00:31:47they can

00:31:49put in

00:31:51all their money,

00:31:52BlackRock and, you know,

McIntosh:00:31:54Morgan Stanley, I don't know, all these different companies.

00:31:58They can put all their money in a custodial solution,

00:32:01which seems to be Coinbase for the most part, and that's fine. That's not the way that I do it, and that's not what I

00:32:08preach, so to speak, but that is

00:32:11there's nothing wrong with that for those people. So, anyways,

00:32:15what was I where was I at? Hash rate, January 1, 2023.

00:32:19We were at approximately 255,000

00:32:22Exashash.

00:32:24So

00:32:24today,

00:32:26We're at roughly 563

00:32:30Exashash. So we have more than doubled,

00:32:33essentially, the mining power

00:32:35in the last year, which is

00:32:38stunning.

00:32:39I don't know where we go from here. Now If I'm going to make estimations,

00:32:44I would say,

McIntosh:00:32:45we don't make,

McIntosh:00:32:47whatever a 1000 Exashash is, a zetahash, think it is,

00:32:52next year.

00:32:53I believe we'll end up somewhere around 750.

00:32:56I think we have to slow down, but I could be wrong.

00:33:01I do believe after the havening, which we'll talk about in just a minute,

00:33:05you will see a drop in hash as servers go offline because it's no longer profitable at least for a short while, but then we'll see it ramp back up.

00:33:15I I am prepared to be wrong on on my estimations. We may be

00:33:20approaching a zeta hash or even above it by the end of next year, which would be insane.

00:33:27Alright.

00:33:28Let's talk about what went on last year, kind of the big stories.

00:33:33And where were we at on this? What does it mean for 2024?

00:33:37Bank failures. We had 3 big bank failures. There was more,

00:33:42But we had 3 big bank failures here in the United States.

00:33:451st Republic.

00:33:47No. Let's go in order. Sorry. Silicon Valley,

00:33:51March 10th,

00:33:54failed. So Silicon Valley Bank was a bank that was used by a lot of the companies in Silicon Valley. They, like, literally companies held $1,000,000,000

00:34:03for payroll, things like this. Companies like Netflix. Now I don't know if Netflix was.

00:34:08Very likely they were, but Maybe they weren't,

00:34:11but that kind of company would have their accounts. And they

00:34:16because of what The fed had done with interest rates driving up.

00:34:21Well, because

00:34:24inflation went up so quickly, they drove up interest rates

00:34:27grew from 0 to 5% in the order of a few months.

00:34:31That

00:34:32put a lot of banks in turmoil.

00:34:34Silicon Valley, like I said,

00:34:36They were they basically went bankrupt,

00:34:39March 10th. March 12th, Signature Bank. That was on a Friday.

00:34:44Signature Bank was on a Sunday, which was very weird.

00:34:48The thing about signature was it was actually

00:34:51responsible for banking some of the exchanges, if I'm not mistaken.

00:34:56I think signature was forced to close,

00:35:00in my opinion. Now that's conspiratorial.

00:35:02I'll just tell you that, but I don't think they were insolvent.

00:35:06I think the SEC

00:35:08closed them or not the SEC, Whoever's in charge of the banks

00:35:12to send a message.

00:35:14Now we've seen crypto

00:35:16regulation all year long, and we're about to talk about that. But,

00:35:21Yeah. I think this was a warning. I don't know. That's just me being conspiratorial

00:35:25probably.

00:35:26And then on May 1st,

00:35:28First National or First Republic Bank. So these three things kinda sent shock waves through the industry,

00:35:34through

00:35:35Finance through,

00:35:37you know, all of that kind of stuff.

00:35:40These are large banks. These were not small little mom and pop banks.

00:35:45There were not super banks like, you know, JPMorgan,

00:35:48Chase,

00:35:51I don't know. City, one of these very large banks, but

00:35:56they were certainly mid level.

00:35:58And they all three

00:35:59within six weeks,

00:36:01or so,

00:36:02kind of, you know, they they were basically bought out for pennies on the dollar, really, by other companies, including JPMorgan.

00:36:10Actually,

00:36:11they bought First Republic.

00:36:13What else did we have going on? Well,

00:36:162023,

00:36:17it looks like,

00:36:18will probably bring the end

00:36:20to the FTX

00:36:22mess.

00:36:23So

00:36:24back early in the year,

00:36:26somewhere around that same time frame, March, April, May, I don't know.

00:36:29A jury convicted,

00:36:32Sam Bankman freed

00:36:33of

00:36:35a number of charges, wire fraud. Well, this is wire fraud and 6 other charges.

00:36:40So he has been cooling his heels in jail

00:36:43for house arrest.

00:36:45Not too long after that, CZ,

00:36:48who was the founder of Binance agreed to plead guilty

00:36:51to money laundering

00:36:54of all things as part of a settlement between the US authorities

00:36:58and Binance.

00:36:59And just recently, he was actually denied the ability to leave the United States.

00:37:04So, essentially, he's trapped here.

00:37:07So that remains to be seen. One of the interesting things about FTX to circle back to that is just recently, it was disclosed.

00:37:14FTX gave, like, $100,000,000

00:37:17to different politicians in the United States,

00:37:19primarily, but not exclusively

00:37:22Democrats.

00:37:23That's a fact. Just throwing that out there.

00:37:26And

00:37:27he will not

00:37:28Sam Bankman Fried will not be charged with that.

00:37:33So, basically, they've come out and said,

00:37:36the the trial that's done, you know, he's found guilty of all that. The penalty phase has not been done yet, but he's in, you know, house arrest or jail. I don't know which.

00:37:48But he will spend

00:37:50basically the rest of his life in jail for that most likely,

00:37:54at least a long time.

00:37:56But they're not going to charge him

00:37:59with all of the other things. There are a number of other charges that were to be done separately, including

00:38:05This campaign

00:38:07fraud, which is what it was.

00:38:11So

00:38:12that's interesting.

00:38:15One of the things that went on this year,

00:38:18the SEC has been cracking down on casino coins as securities. So what this means is

00:38:24they're going into places

00:38:26and like Kraken. They're saying, Kraken,

00:38:30You have been dealing in

00:38:32unregistered

00:38:33securities, which is what they call them because they are securities,

00:38:37and they're not registered

00:38:39as such.

00:38:40And I think in Kraken's case, they paid a $30,000,000

00:38:44fine. Now I don't know what came out of that other than a fine,

00:38:48but that's just one example. Coinbase,

00:38:51same thing.

00:38:52They've gone after Ripple. The Ripple case kind of settled. Basically, they were saying

00:38:58the people who bought the coins on the Changes were not guilty of anything,

00:39:03which is I mean, really, what are you gonna do?

00:39:06I think they're still trying to get to the people

00:39:11in charge of Ripple. So Ripple's a company. Actually, it's Ripple Labs.

00:39:16But, you know,

00:39:18Whatever. I don't know. Ripples' security,

00:39:21and they called it as such, at least in certain cases,

00:39:24which I don't know how that works, but whatever.

00:39:27So, anyways, the last figure I've seen,

00:39:31I think this is a legitimate

00:39:33number. I've looked at it a couple times.

00:39:36There have been 68 different tokens that have been declared to be securities. So 68. Bitcoin, of course, is not among them because Coin is not a security,

00:39:47for a number of reasons, but and I don't think Ethereum is listed at this point. Now I think the SEC is Setting Ethereum aside.

00:39:56In my opinion,

00:39:58Ethereum very much is a security,

00:40:00probably more so than The vast majority of those stupid tokens,

00:40:05but they're they're setting them aside for, you know, whatever.

00:40:11To make a example of maybe in the next few years. We'll see. But it well, I'm not gonna go down the Ethereum rabbit hole. It doesn't Matter we don't talk about Ethereum here.

00:40:22But funny things are going on over there. They are becoming they are realizing

00:40:26I will say this. They are realizing they have to now that they moved to proof of stake. They're going to end up being even more centralized

00:40:33in terms of their Collinators. I'm like, man, you geniuses didn't see that coming.

00:40:38Whatever.

00:40:40China news. You guys know I like to talk about China.

00:40:43There was 2 big things out of China this year, and I think both of them are very important. Evergrande

00:40:48went bankrupt.

00:40:51They had been defaulting on their debt.

00:40:54Let's see. I think that was in 2022.

00:40:59In 2023,

00:41:00they did go bankrupt in August.

00:41:02So they are officially bankrupt.

00:41:04Not sure really what's gonna happen at this point.

00:41:07There's some kind of ruling that's happening soon

00:41:11on that.

00:41:12Country Gardens,

00:41:14The other big real estate company essentially

00:41:18in China,

00:41:19they have not defaulted, but their sales are down a stupid amount of money.

00:41:24That's like 81%

00:41:26year over year,

00:41:29in September.

00:41:30So a few months ago, They did report $7,000,000,000,

00:41:34that's billion with a b, dollars loss in the first half of twenty twenty three.

00:41:40So I think they will be defaulting and going bankrupt as well. They're just a little behind Evergrande.

00:41:46I think that saga will continue, and what people don't understand

00:41:51is that a lot of the financial wealth that was built up in China was done.

00:41:57A significant percentage. I'm not gonna give it a number, but it's not like 5%. It's, you know, much larger than that.

00:42:06Was done through fine,

00:42:07real estate,

00:42:08through companies like these 2 companies. That's why you saw

00:42:14Literal cities being built

00:42:16that were empty, and that's been reported. I'm not gonna go into that, but

00:42:22It this will hurt China in the long run very significantly.

00:42:25What do we have coming in 2024?

00:42:27I've written down a few things. I think these are are very important. I think these will help fuel

00:42:35Bitcoin.

00:42:36We already know about the 4 year cycle. We already know, you know, we're kind of in that paradigm,

00:42:41but these are the things that

00:42:43the reasons why I think we're gonna come out of 2024.

00:42:46You know, we're at 42,000,

00:42:48roughly

00:42:4943,000

00:42:50right now.

00:42:51We could be double that towards the end of the year. It may be higher.

00:42:56So we got to have an incoming in late April. So at block height,

00:43:01840,000.

00:43:04Oh, I did not do

00:43:07what our current block height is.

00:43:09Man, Macintosh.

00:43:11823,771.

00:43:16Let me jot that down.

00:43:22Okay.

00:43:23So that's our current block height. I'm not gonna go through the difficulty or whatever. Fees are still crazy high.

00:43:29Right now, it's looking like about 200 stats per vbite.

00:43:33Very little relief in that. It's all I'm gonna say about that for right now.

00:43:39Still on target.

00:43:43Who was that that said that in Star Wars? Was that Luke? I can't remember.

McIntosh:00:43:49Alright.

00:43:49Sorry.

00:43:51Squirrels run amok.

00:43:53Halvening.

McIntosh:00:43:55The block reward will go from 0.25 Bitcoin down to 3.175

00:44:00Bitcoin

00:44:02plus the transaction fees. So we will see an immediate cut

00:44:06in the reward.

00:44:08So that's coming. We've got US elections in November November 5th, our general election

00:44:14next year.

00:44:15Why is that important?

00:44:18Well, being the conspiracy theorist that I am, I would argue that regardless of whomever

00:44:24is in Our, whether that be Republican or Democrat, during an election year, they will do everything in their power to make the market look Good. Because a bad economy is the easiest way to get someone out of office.

00:44:38What does that mean? Hey.

00:44:40If I'm Joe Biden,

00:44:42which I am not, but if I'm Joe Biden, I tap,

00:44:45Powell on the shoulder

00:44:47and say, hey, buddy.

00:44:49you need to start bringing down interest rates

00:44:52because when you start bringing down interest rates, that's gonna mean that people are gonna start investing,

00:44:57and the economy

00:44:59is going to do better.

00:45:01People will feel better and so on and so forth.

McIntosh:00:45:05So that's coming.

00:45:07Now

McIntosh:00:45:08Now we know Powell is already even saying kind of we've reached the top. We're probably gonna hold here for a few more months.

00:45:15I'm expecting by the end of Q1, so January, February, March,

00:45:20Right around that happening that we start seeing the interest rates drop,

00:45:25which will

00:45:26push Jay, boom. People don't realize

00:45:29even though the financial markets are in terrible shape in terms in a lot of metrics, by pure numbers,

00:45:37One of the markets is in an all time high. I don't remember which one, the S and P or whatever,

00:45:43which one of those it was,

00:45:45But they're doing very well. And if they break out,

00:45:50what we're going to see, in my opinion,

00:45:53especially as these interest rates drop. We're gonna see a market boom. I think over the summer,

00:45:59the stock market's gonna go crazy,

00:46:02And we've seen this in the past. We saw it, by the way,

00:46:06after,

00:46:07the great depression started,

00:46:09kind of during that,

00:46:11Well, the thirties. Right? We saw that stuff going on back then.

00:46:16So the lower interest rates, The stock market will shoot up. Everybody's gonna rah rah rah. Now what's gonna happen,

00:46:24I believe in 2024,

00:46:26we will see. Now this is my speculation,

00:46:30but I believe that we'll see the commercial real estate market crash.

00:46:34Why? Well, I've talked about that.

00:46:36Vacancy rates are very high.

00:46:39This is a combination

00:46:41not a combination. It's primarily driven by COVID.

00:46:44When people left for COVID, when nobody was working at the office,

00:46:49a lot of these people decided they like working remotely.

00:46:53And so companies are coming up with all kinds of, you know, you either work at home or maybe you come in 1 day a week or you do some kind of hybrid thing.

00:47:02Not as much office space

00:47:04usage. Also,

00:47:05we've had a lot of layoffs. We've had hundreds of thousands of people who are getting laid off from these big tech companies and this kind of thing.

00:47:14We've also had companies going bankrupt quietly.

00:47:19So you've got companies going out of business. You got companies who are downsizing, and you've got companies who are to stay competitive

00:47:27moving to this Kinda hybrid working model where people are working from home more.

00:47:32My own company, not that I own it, but the company I work for,

00:47:36for example,

00:47:37Owned, like, 3 floors of an office building, and I'm not even gonna say where because it's not relevant and it's none of your business.

00:47:45But they've given up one of those. Not that they owned it. They were leasing that. They gave it up, and now that floor just sits it sits empty. There are markets where there are extremely high vacancy rates, and these companies, especially with these high interest rates, are going to start going bankrupt. These are the commercial

00:48:03real estate companies.

00:48:05Companies like Evergrande

00:48:07and,

00:48:08Country Garden in China. Now those were

00:48:11slightly different, but those are

00:48:14for maybe for different reasons, really. But

00:48:17The those

00:48:18kind of companies, real estate investment companies, companies who own buildings who then lease them out.

00:48:26I do not know what the implications

00:48:28are of that. I don't know if that's going to cause a general crash of the market.

00:48:33I'm not gonna speculate on that. I do not know.

00:48:37I believe it will cause a significant

00:48:39drag,

00:48:40but this market has to reset.

00:48:43The prices have to reset.

00:48:46The expectations

00:48:47have to reset. All of this has to be done

00:48:51before we could even talk about moving forward.

00:48:53I do think that will happen in 2025.

00:48:56I will say in general also,

00:48:58I don't think 2025

00:48:59for most people is gonna be any better than 2024.

00:49:02I hope you are doing well. Some of us are, But there's a lot of people, frankly, who are hurting.

00:49:09And, I hope that, you know, you, the listeners, of course, are not in that case. I'm sure some of you are unfortunately

00:49:17and I hope 2025

00:49:18or 2024

00:49:19is better for you.

00:49:21I'm not sure that that's gonna be the case. I think I misspoke earlier and said 2025

00:49:26instead of 2024.

00:49:28But just in general,

00:49:29I think that 2024 is going to be Not a whole lot different than 2023.

00:49:35We may not reach a level of great depression, and I was pretty doom and gloom about a year or so ago.

00:49:42I'm

00:49:44still very pessimistic,

00:49:45but we may not reach that level at this point.

00:49:49We will see. It is possible

00:49:52that we could pull ourselves out of this and continue to build debt. Oh, by the way, the US is poised.

00:49:58I believe well, we're at, like,

00:50:00$33,900,000,000,000.

00:50:03So we're almost $34,000,000,000,000

McIntosh:00:50:05of debt. I don't think we're gonna quite make it

00:50:08before

McIntosh:00:50:092024, but I'm sure that will be happening very soon in January.

00:50:14So there you go.

00:50:15That debt has to get taken care of. The global debt has to get taken care of some somewhere. We there's just way, way, way too much.

McIntosh:00:50:24And how that's done through default or or through,

00:50:28you know,

McIntosh:00:50:30I can't think of the word right now, but you're making your money Worthless.

00:50:35It has to be done one way or the other.

00:50:38Remains to be seen how that's done. Anyways, enough about that. Let's talk about some other things. The SEC and various other guns government institutions are going to continue to regulate the crypto market.

00:50:51We have people in our government who are dead set against any kind of crypto other than central bank digital currencies.

00:50:59Elizabeth Warren, who's a senator here in the United States, is a prime example. She has a bill that she is trying to float

00:51:06that

00:51:06I hope

00:51:08get shot down. That will do everything possible to shut down crypto.

00:51:12I think we will continue to see that in twenty 24, I think you will see it more on the side of crypto rather than Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will see its fair share as well.

00:51:23I hope all this ordinals,

00:51:24inscriptions, stamps, and BRC 20 crap fades off into the background. I don't think we should be censoring Yeah. I don't as a minor, frankly, I'm benefiting from it every day,

00:51:35but I also don't think it's a a good use

00:51:39of the blockchain.

00:51:40I think that we are pricing people out who,

00:51:45are not ready for that.

00:51:48We know ultimately in the long run that blockchain space on the Bitcoin main chain will become very expensive.

00:51:55But right now, I don't want it to be $50 just to do something on the main chain. I think lightning is going to continue to become more mature And more stable, god, I hope they fix all these force channel closures

00:52:08because especially with these high fee environments, that gets to be very expensive to reopen those. I also think it will probably become more centralized, which is something I would love to not see, but I also fully expect.

00:52:21I don't expect the e cash systems like Fedimint and ARC to take off in 2024.

00:52:27I do expect to see significant process progress

00:52:30on them. I also hope to see serious progress is made towards main chain, I mean, the Bitcoin main chain privacy.

00:52:38Privacy by default should be the model.

00:52:40I would love to see Monero's model

00:52:43essentially on Bitcoin.

00:52:46I don't know why at this point that we haven't given serious attention to that. We can use Whirlpool. We can use things like that, and we'll be talking about those through the year.

00:52:55But I want to see it baked into the main chain. We're over here arguing about

00:53:01covenants and this, that, and the other.

00:53:04To me, privacy is the number one concern right now on Bitcoin because we don't know what governments around the world are going to do, and I will continue to use Bitcoin regardless of what they say.

00:53:15And I would love to have my right to privacy, which as a US citizen is guaranteed to me in the constitution

00:53:22even though it's routinely

00:53:24trampled on.

00:53:26I also hope that Satoshi plebs listeners stack more sats, To maintain more self custody and gain more knowledge about Bitcoin and financial freedom.

00:53:35That is my predictions for 2024.

00:53:38In terms of price, In case I didn't say it, I think I did at least roughly. I wrote down 50 to 60,000

McIntosh:00:53:45by having,

00:53:46So in just a few months,

00:53:4880 k plus

00:53:50by end of year. I am

McIntosh:00:53:53purposely underestimating the effects Spot ETF

00:53:57potentially

00:53:58by a lot.

00:53:59I still believe

00:54:00at this point, 2025,

00:54:03Q4,

00:54:04probably November, if you forced my hand on it,

00:54:07will be the top of this cycle. And until proven otherwise,

00:54:12I will maintain that position.

00:54:15So

00:54:16we have an exciting couple of years. We are at the start, if not already past the start. In fact, it could be argued we're past the start

00:54:24of the bull market. So welcome to 2024.

00:54:27Dear listeners,

00:54:29I hope it will be a good one. I need to throw out some shouts,

00:54:33shout outs or whatever you say

00:54:36To some supporters, we did have some support come in after I posted the last episode,

00:54:42and this was for episode 148, mere mortals podcast, which Kyron.

00:54:47Our friend Kyron over there, sent 2222,

00:54:51a row of ducks.

00:54:52And he said,

00:54:53Satoshi plebs, fitting since you like the socioplebis

00:54:57motto

00:54:58so much. Thank you, Kyron. I put a lot of thought into that name,

00:55:01and I really like it. I hope y'all do as well.

00:55:05Episode 147,

00:55:07Hypersentivosaurus

00:55:08sent us 1,000 sats,

00:55:11our friend in Portugal.

00:55:13And, no message, and then sent another 1,000 sat and said, have a great December. I am going for a family time I tripped to the Netherlands myself, so sounds like they went back home.

00:55:26He's told us before that he is from the Netherlands.

00:55:29So I hope you had a great holiday.

00:55:32Hypersentivosaurus

00:55:33,

00:55:34I did. I enjoyed myself. I did work too much,

00:55:37But I've told y'all before, I'm a workaholic.

00:55:40I really wanted to get this stuff done, and I'm very pleased with how my I had more stuff. I have a list,

00:55:46but I did get a lot done. So and I also got to spend some time with my family and our friends and doing so tonight in just a few hours actually

00:55:55as well.

00:55:57So very cool.

00:55:58And thank you very much, hypersensitive.

00:56:01I do appreciate your support as always. And anonymous

00:56:05Sent us another 500 sets. I think he's sending 500 every time.

00:56:09Really cool. No message. Thank you. Anonymous as always. I appreciate that.

00:56:14Not gonna have any news and notes this week. I kinda covered everything. I think ETFs for the last month have kinda been the big news.

00:56:21You've probably already caught up about that elsewhere, and that's fine.

00:56:26Alright.

00:56:26So, of course, Satoshi's

00:56:28Plebs podcast. Boy, I'm gonna have to learn how to say that. That's fun.

00:56:33Y'all know I have trouble sometimes.

00:56:36Satoshis Plebs podcast

00:56:38supports podcasting 2.0. It's a value for value podcast as I talk about time and time again. I don't have ads. I don't have sponsorships. I don't have anything like that. You can support the podcast in a couple of ways.

00:56:50You can support it by time, by talent, by treasure.

00:56:54What do I mean? Well, I've still got projects. I as I've outlined, I will have projects

00:56:59through

00:57:002024.

00:57:01There will always be projects. There's always things that people can help out on if they wish.

00:57:07That's the time and talent. If you've got treasure, if you've got some Bitcoin that you wanna support the show with, if this Show brings you value

00:57:17on a week in, week out basis, and I certainly hope it does.

00:57:21Please do 2 things. First of all, Promote the show. Let other people know. Say, hey. There's this guy, Macintosh.

00:57:28Does this show called Satoshi's Plebs? You can find did on any podcast 2 point o app. You can even find it on Apple Podcasts.

00:57:37But, go take a listen, And you can leave a review, which that would be nice. And then also, you can, if you're using a podcasting 2 point o app, you can stream some sats. You can boost and send a message

00:57:48Just like hypersensitive

00:57:50asaris and mere mortals did

00:57:52and anonymous.

00:57:54You can also if you really love Apple Podcasts, For example, you can go to podcast index.com.

00:58:01You can look up Satoshi's Plebs, and you can boost straight from there with an Alby wallet, which is simply a lightning wallet.

00:58:08So you can do it that way even without a podcasting 2 point o app.

00:58:14Alright. I'm gonna skip through

00:58:16Oh, some of this because, man,

00:58:18I got to get this edited and posted.

00:58:21Fountain

00:58:22podcast, I believe, is in 1 point o now. If it's not, it will be very soon.

00:58:27It's been a very solid

00:58:29app.

00:58:30I really like what they've done, especially

00:58:32with the clipping.

00:58:34The new clipping feature

00:58:36is a vast improvement. I think I told him it was a 2000%

00:58:40improvement, and I was not exaggerating.

00:58:43The other one used to frustrate me to no end, and this one's beautiful.

00:58:46It just works. It's great.

00:58:48You can check that out, fountain.fm

00:58:51Or there's a number of others. I use,

00:58:56I don't have it right. Customatic.
