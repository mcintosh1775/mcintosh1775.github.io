[00:00:00] McIntosh:

Welcome back to Satoshi's Plebs for episode two thirty one. I'm McIntosh. Awesome. Hey, Kenshin. Right now, as we start recording, we are at Block Height 921. Actually, I wanna double check. Sorry. 921516. It's a good thing I checked. So we are recording on Thursday instead of Wednesday because I was laying in a dentist chair yesterday when we normally record. I would rather have been here, but the dentist said otherwise. So there we go. What's going on with you, sir? I I hear you guys, like, switch time or something. I don't know what's going on. Crazy people. Yeah. We went one hour 

[00:00:57] Kenshin:

back, I think. Yeah. We gained one hour. So so that's quite cool. 

Which is it's funny because on, when was it? Sunday. The the date felt like it wasn't ending. Just one hour difference. It was a never ending Sunday. Yeah. It was a formula one race on Sunday at 9PM in the night, so, I wanted the day to end. So so it was That's funny. 

[00:01:27] McIntosh:

Oh, well, we have our time change here in The United States this Sunday. I don't know why they're not in sync. I have no idea. I don't understand the whole thing. The whole thing makes no sense to me. Yeah. But I will show I will say that this is the level of incompetence we have. Have a United States government. Do we go to even agree to repeal daylight savings time or whatever they call it. They voted on it or tried to vote on it or whatever again and could not get it passed. Even though I guarantee you 90% of the people in The United States do not think that we should be doing these crazy time changes. 

[00:02:02] Kenshin:

Yeah. And there are some countries that they don't do it anymore. No. Well, there are states that don't do it. Like Oh, really? Yes. 

[00:02:10] McIntosh:

Arizona refuses to participate in this madness. And, like, there's a county or I don't think it's whole state of Indiana that they just don't do it. I mean, it's insane. It doesn't even matter why it was originally in place. It's no longer needed, and it's just it's stupid. Anyways so your time changed. What else is going on? 

[00:02:36] Kenshin:

I'm free this week. Having some, more so called vacations. 

[00:02:45] McIntosh:

So work? What does that mean? Does that mean you have a honey do list? 



[00:02:50] Kenshin:

No. I mean, no. I'm working only on, on our projects, my wife's projects and mine, or at least trying to get back into it because I didn't do almost anything for the past two months since August that I started traveling. Right. Yeah. So now I'm back full speed on it and I'm quite happy with Claude 

[00:03:13] McIntosh:

for once. Yes. I'm surprised. Much better. 

[00:03:16] Kenshin:

Yeah. He's he's back to its usual, level, I would say. And it feels good. It's like now, okay, I have a problem here and he's like, yeah, I fixed it. I check. Oh, he did fix it. So so that's a good feeling. 



[00:03:30] McIntosh:

Cool. 

[00:03:32] Kenshin:

So, so being at home the whole week, basically, days and nights have blend in again, like I don't know. How it feels. But, yeah. Not looking forward to this week ending, actually. Then it's back to work next week. 

[00:03:50] McIntosh:

You know, I told my wife something this week. I said, I'm glad that we got married because she didn't know whether to take this as a good thing, a compliment, or or what. I said, I'm glad we got married because if we hadn't got married, I'd be one of those programmer dudes that just, like, you wake up in the morning and you start programming, and you program all day, and there's, like, empty pizza boxes laying around you. 

And you just kinda fall over at the keyboard at night and sleep a little bit, and then you wake back up and you start programming it again. And that's that's true. It's that is a little bit more with that? It's not conducive to a good family life, sir. That is true. 

[00:04:42] Kenshin:

Right. 

[00:04:43] McIntosh:

Yeah. So, anyways, I try and not do that. Sometimes I do. I do work. I'm well never mind. Yeah. 

[00:04:52] Kenshin:

How did your dentist go? Well, 

[00:04:56] McIntosh:

our stupid like, I'd been going to the same dentist for probably ten years or more, and they no longer accept the insurance that I'm on. So I had to change, and it was something I put off. 

It's been like a year, so that's I was naughty, naughty McIntosh. But I did set up the appointment, and now I went in, and they've done all the X rays and whatever. And about three quarters of the way through, I'm like, are we planning on doing cleaning today? Because I really don't think I'm up for this. And we actually so now my cleaning will be in December, rather than trying to be there for an hour and a half, you know, with your mouth open in the doctor's chair, which is not fun. So I I'm getting back into the swing of it, so to speak. No major issues, you know, just just kind of going through the process. 



[00:05:52] Kenshin:

Right. 

[00:05:54] McIntosh:

You know? Mhmm. I don't know. Not a whole lot this week. It's funny you were talking about I'm starting to plan my kind of my fall activities, my fall and winter activities. There are things that I put off around the yard, so to speak, because it's so hot here during the summer. Mhmm. One of the things that I do, they make it like a it's like a heavy duty brush mower mower type machine. I don't know what else to call it, but you push it. It's well, it's motorized. The wheels spin, but you you you control it from you walk behind it. Okay? And it can mow down some pretty decent stuff. And I've got areas of my yard, outer parts of my yard that need to be cleaned up. So I'm planning on doing that. We had a section of our front fence that actually fell down the other day because it's just so old. 

And we've been talking for multiple years about replacing that, and we've now officially decided what we're going to do. So we're in the process of taking that down, and we'll get it cleaned up. And then there's a row of trees right there that we're also gonna cut down, and then we're gonna plant a hedgerow, essentially, back in its place. So the hedgerow will kind of provide the privacy and cut down on the road noise and that kind of thing Right. And, be a little easier to maintain, I think, and certainly will not rot and fall over in the long term. 

[00:07:34] Kenshin:

That's a good thing. 

Yes. Did you have to do it this week? Or 

[00:07:40] McIntosh:

that started this week. The mowing will start in about another week, and we'll we'll probably be doing this until Thanksgiving, which is another month from now. May might be four weeks from today, actually. I think it is. Let's see. Thanksgiving is at ten. Weeks. Black Friday, is it? Yeah. No. That's the day after Thanksgiving. 

[00:08:05] Kenshin:

That's the important part. 

[00:08:07] McIntosh:

Oh, stop. That is not true. I am not that shallow. One, two, three. No. Actually, well, yeah, it's four weeks from today. One, two, three. Right. Four weeks from today. So there we go. It's one of my favorite holidays, to be honest. 

We'll talk about that another time, but I have not been Black Friday shopping for for quite a while. Alright. Alright. So, Kenshin, we've got kind of a difficult topic today. I'm just gonna go ahead and and say that. And if you're listening to this podcast, especially if you've been a regular listener to this podcast, I would ask you respectfully to listen to the whole thing. This is not our normal content, but we don't I don't really believe in hiding things from our listeners, first of all. And we really want to try and improve things. So we're going to talk about some the reality of kind of our situation. 

I I did about a ten minute thing on this last week. And then when I was editing it, I decided to cut it out because I felt like I didn't wanna duplicate things, and it also needed a full episode, really, I feel like, to actually get through all of this. So Kenshin and I have been discussing this for a number of weeks at this point, and so we're just gonna jump right in. Here's kind of the reality. I've been doing this podcast for over four years. Kenshin has been with me, for the best part of that the last year almost. 

And, so we have some history. We are slowly growing. You can look back. We have been hitting some consistent targets, and I'm I'm not gonna discuss those at this point. I don't really feel like we need to. But for a podcast that's been around this long, frankly, it's not as high as I would like. And how can well, it's not enough to support us. Not that we're looking to be, like, full time from this podcast. But you guys, this is a value for value podcast. And what that means is we respectfully, every week, ask you to come and provide time, talent, treasure for what you get back in value. So we provide value, and, materially, people send Satoshis to us to support us through podcasting apps like Fountain. 

It's a great concept. There are people who do that full time. But if you listen to our support section, we don't have a whole lot of content. And I please please listen to this in the way that we're bringing it. I am not how can I put this? I am not I don't mean anything mean by this. This I am not begging either for the people who are already listening to provide more support. What Kenshin and I are trying to do is figure out how we can build a better podcast. Okay? That's going to involve more people listening, and it's going to involve changes. So I'm just kind of laying the groundwork. 

We pay, like, $15 a month for podcast hosting. There's hosting fees for the website. That doesn't even get into things like I would love to, like, probably use Clear Feed for our communication back and forth, which is another $30 a month and so on and so forth. What we're bringing in right now, it doesn't even cover that, and that's okay. But it's not okay in the long term. It's not. We I've done this a long time. Kenshin's been here. He feels like he's been here for a long time, but he's certainly been here for a bit. We have to have a long term plan because we are investing hours a week doing this, hours and hours a week doing this, and we're pulling money out of our pocket in order to to do this. 

I'm trying to provide this as a service to the Bitcoin community for people who are plebs, who are maybe just getting started, or maybe they're midway through their Bitcoin journey or that kind of thing to be able to provide them with quality information and and quality content. But it has to be sustainable in the long run. So I say all that. We're gonna run through some things that that we feel like can improve the show. We're going to talk some more about value for value and the possibilities of us doing something in addition to that. Is that is that all sound good to you, Kenshin? 



[00:13:20] Kenshin:

Yeah. Sounds good. We have a few things to discuss and, yeah, I agree that the and the motivation for this, as you say, it's is to see how we can grow and make a better podcast. And it's for us also to be motivated to put those hours in week after week. Of course. It gets a little demotivating 

[00:13:42] McIntosh:

when you you're Yeah. You know, paying for their pod host off the credit card that comes out of my pocket. You know? It is. Okay. So these are not in any particular order either, by the way. I I wrote these down, and, Kenshin wrote these down as we thought of them. 

So these are not, like, in rank. Some of these are gonna be easier to do than others, and they will probably be done first. But we are looking I I wanna talk about this first one. If and maybe I'll why don't you why don't you just pick one that you wanna talk about? We'll just kinda mark them off as because there may be some that you don't wanna talk about. Maybe. I don't know. But the first one is audio improvements. As a person who has edited a podcast for going on, like, six or seven years now because I was actually doing this on a different podcast, editing the audio before this podcast came about. 

Audio is very important to me, and I am very aware of the limitations that I have in terms of audio. And it's something that we would like to improve. There's things we can do, like, add a noise gate to get rid of very low level noises that sometime creep in. That's just one simple example. Another audio improvement, frankly, would be we both could use new microphones because I know this microphone here that I'm using probably cost well under a $100. And you there are times when you pay for quality. And when it comes to microphone, that is actually one of those things. You buy a more expensive microphone, and frankly, they sound better. There's only so much you can do post production, as they would say. 

So that's one of the things. Kenshin? 

[00:15:39] Kenshin:

In included in that one, I would say, like a soundboard or, how is it called? Like a stream tech? I don't know how they call you know, you have a concept. Soundboard would be, very, very helpful for this. It would let us add in 

[00:15:56] McIntosh:

sound effects, and I I don't know. I kinda go back and forth on that. Sometimes maybe they're a little cheesy, but at the same time, I sit there. There are certain podcasts that I listen to that use them a lot, and I just sit there, and it's just I don't know. I I enjoy it. So Yeah. The per I don't know. Perceived quality. Right? 



[00:16:17] Kenshin:

Mhmm. Just the transition 

[00:16:19] McIntosh:

sounds or something. See, right here, we should have a big hand clap. Clap. Right. Okay. Yeah. So there and I would kinda put that under audio improvements, as well because that would certainly be something that would be helpful there. So Mhmm. You got another you wanna do? 

[00:16:39] Kenshin:

Yeah. I mean, we have done live streaming. Mhmm. We did with the zap.dot stream. Yes. And that went well sometimes. I think we had up to Right. Seven live listeners at some point. But it's hard a bit to set up OBS. Once you set it up, it's fine. But it's Right. It's the lack of time. It's tricky. Yeah. Yeah. To get everything you want right Mhmm. And to have it a bit more interactive. What we had so far was just a static image. How much a test? Yeah. Yeah. It was very static and just a waveform and that was it. So now I'm trying to set it up a bit more live that we have our faces. 



[00:17:25] McIntosh:

It it doesn't make it any easier that neither one of us really want our face on a YouTube channel. Right? Right. 

[00:17:32] Kenshin:

But I think we can we can do it in a way that's solvable problems. Yeah. Yeah. We can do it in a good way, but it requires a few hours of work. Mhmm. So do we spend those hours and invest in in that setup, with better live streaming or or maybe it's not something that people care about. If if they just listen to the audio in the podcast app and and that's it and they don't care about the live, then Yeah. Then let us know. Yeah. That that's good to know. And because then it is and if you do want to listen live, is there a day of the week and a time of the week that is 

[00:18:10] McIntosh:

is better for you? Yeah. 



[00:18:13] Kenshin:

And now we are one in US, one in Europe. I mean, that's tricky to find a good 

[00:18:18] McIntosh:

time that fits the whole audience. It's harder than you would think. Yeah. I mean, we got this and that and yeah. Yeah. So let us know about that. 

[00:18:29] Kenshin:

Yeah. For sure. And to finalize this point, it's live on NoStar. There is a few options. Mhmm. It's YouTube live. That's a big option as well. Right. Then there is podcasting two point o live options. Right. Just a little to do that. Right. 

[00:18:48] McIntosh:

And I believe there's a tool. I've got it in here somewhere. Restreamer. Kind of automate all yeah. That was it. Re what what what is it? Resplit? 



[00:18:58] Kenshin:

Restreamer, I think. Restream something like that. There are a few. 

[00:19:02] McIntosh:

You know, it would be best to use something like that for that to so that we don't have to kinda cobble something together. But, again, that's more money. 

[00:19:12] Kenshin:

Yeah. So so if you want live streaming, what type of live streaming? When? Is it important to you or not? And and what platforms? What platform do you listen to? If you listen to others, it's important. Yeah. 

[00:19:26] McIntosh:

Another thing that, I think I came up with this idea. I'm kind of proud of it. I hope it works out, but this would require money, quite honestly. 

I feel like I didn't let me back up. When I brought on a co host, when I brought on Kenshin, I did not specifically choose him because he was in Europe. But it's worked out really well, in my opinion. You, Kenshin, provide a great perspective on what's going on in the EU, and you don't make too much fun of me with things like I don't know that Switzerland was Oh, I do. EU. Okay. I would like to expand that a bit. I would love to bring in you guys know I I I don't actually talk about Africa and South America as much as I used to, to be honest. But I love to talk about the thriving communities, Bitcoin communities that are going on in Africa and the way that well, I don't guess we've had any really big breakouts in Africa at this point. But eventually, there will be countries that adopt a Bitcoin standard, and I believe that will actually, accelerate their growth. 

In South America, we have El Salvador. You've got Argentina, for example, which in my opinion is going through a change. Sometimes it's very bumpy, but, you know, they're you can do anything you want with Bitcoin down there, essentially. There's a lot going on, and I would love probably once a month to bring on somebody, the same person from Africa and from South America. I have an idea about somebody from Africa. To be honest, they probably won't have the time, but I'm hopeful that they will. Somebody from South America that I can reach out to as well. But I'm looking for somebody to bring in the perspective of those con continents that we do not have. 

Kenshin, have you ever been to Africa or South America? I have not. No. You go to Africa? I would I would rather bring in somebody who's there, who's involved in Bitcoin there who can talk about it. And I cannot ask somebody to do that on a regular basis if I'm not willing to to pay them, if I'm not able to pay them. So that is definitely something that would we we would have to have money for. 

[00:22:06] Kenshin:

Right. Alright? Another one. More clips. We also did a few clips. So we clip, like, minute or two and Mhmm. Posted it on Noister. We did post it on Twitter also. 

Yes. But, yeah, we posted on Noister a clip or we tried to do two clips, a week. 

[00:22:32] McIntosh:

And I think we got good response from that. 

[00:22:35] Kenshin:

Yeah. But again But it's hard to make the time. Yeah. It it Yeah. Exactly. That's needed at least an hour of work just for that. Mhmm. And, yeah, it feels good when we do it and the reaction and probably it helps the podcast as well. So, again, the question is have people noticed it before when we did it? Did they think it was a good idea? Should we do it again? That's Okay. Yeah. Not much more to it. That's the question. Yeah. 

[00:23:13] McIntosh:

Alright. So this is a little more involved. 

I have recently been working on a project to help my wife where we're going to build there's a technical term for it called a it's a RAG, which is an acronym, and I can never remember exactly what that stands for, but it's an AI tool so that we can bring in very specific content for her use case so that she can query it based on that content. Okay? Mhmm. It's how you get it's how you build a specialized AI system for a particular situation. I would like to do the same thing for the podcast. This actually would not take a huge amount of effort after I do it for my wife because it'll basically just be the same thing. We would feed in. 

I'm thinking probably every episode that you and I have been on together, plus maybe a few there's some specific older episodes I'd probably like to pull in. Mhmm. But that way, when we're sitting here on the show going, well, we said one time back in, you know, 1934, blah blah blah, we can just query the database. Or we can add specific content, like dates or historical things or whatever to to be able to pull from as well. I think it would be a very useful tool for us, but it will take some time. I can run it right here on my little desk top that I have enough disk space, and it would definitely run on that. 

But, again, it's it's just more time. And, really, you're talking about something that's now it's gonna start kind of eating into my AI bills, so to speak. I do pay for my AI. And so there's a there's a monetary element as well. But that, I think, would would help quite a bit. We already use I well, I certainly I believe you do as well. We already use AI quite a bit just for the show prep and, show notes and this kind of thing because AI may not be perfect, but, man, it'll get you a long way in a real quick hurry. 

[00:25:24] Kenshin:

Yeah. Some, quick, show note. Yeah. 

Notes. So not not exactly what to say, but, yeah, the structure of it. So that's it's good in that way. 

[00:25:38] McIntosh:

Alright. What do you got next? 

[00:25:41] Kenshin:

What about having more, clips during the podcast that we discussed? Like like you have noted here, like Christine Lagarde. We Yes. We had a clip of her one time, and you had another one. Recent one. Mhmm. Yeah. And just to comment on on on those clips, what they say and, yeah, what we think about them. So we yeah. I I like it, and that also takes a little bit of time, not too much. Right. But, it's the editing time also that it takes. This one. It will add into show prep for sure, and it will add into post 

[00:26:21] McIntosh:

production Yeah. You know, into into the 

[00:26:24] Kenshin:

audio production there. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. But sometimes it's good to to get the original 

[00:26:30] McIntosh:

very good. And there are other podcasts who do this. I don't know if you've ever noticed that, but they'll pull in clips from various sources. 

And it really just look. It's one thing for me to sit here and prattle on about, I don't know, how the EU hates Visa and Mastercard. It's another thing for you to hear Christine Lagarde who's the head of something over there. Sorry. I boy, that sounds like a stupid American. European Central Bank. Is she head of the ECB? Yeah. I wasn't I actually did not know that. I should know that. Anyways, I forgot it. But, yeah, you know, she doesn't like me Visa and Mastercard, which is actually perfectly understandable. But, you know, play a clip and she'll say it and gives a little more impact, I think. Yeah. That's what I'm getting at. Mhmm. Yeah. Alright. One real simple thing. I'm gonna just go ahead and throw this out real quick. 

We're gonna add a donation page. I'm I'm gonna be doing this shortly when I can find five minutes to do it. I love Fountain. I love Podcasting two point o. I do. I I've been involved with them since day one. Not everybody uses Fountain or Podcasting two point o app or even understands what lightning is at this point. Okay? They've got a PayPal account, and they wanna maybe support us. You can do, like, a $5 a month PayPal donation. A long time ago, I stopped using PayPal because of their policies about kicking people off their platform, deplatforming people. But the reality is in this situation, it's probably losing me money losing us money. Sorry, Kenshin. 

And I I would not want that to affect our ability to to receive support. So I will be adding something like that back very soon. 

[00:28:26] Kenshin:

Right. Yeah. Which one is is the other one, that you kind of subscribe 

[00:28:33] McIntosh:

monthly? Patreon is one. Patreon. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if there's a Bitcoin based one. There really probably should be. If not, but, yeah, there's a few things, and I will probably try to include as many as possible. Because if we're gonna go down this road, we might as well make the gates as wide as possible. Right? 

[00:28:52] Kenshin:

Yeah. Why not? Let's try. But, yeah. I I was very against PayPal, as you said. I Yeah. Deleted my account a few years ago when they had this. 

Yeah. Whatever. And that that story that broke out four years ago. But, 

[00:29:09] McIntosh:

Has it been that long? Wow. Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:29:13] Kenshin:

I believe it. But anyway yeah. If people are willing to use PayPal and the friction is much less than making a new Hey. Light new wheels. May say the wrong thing, and we may get deplatformed, but we'll cross that bridge if it happens. Right? Yeah. 

[00:29:29] McIntosh:

As they say or something. I don't know. Macintosh is babbling again. Alright. Let's talk about show prep. Right. We do, at this point, what we feel like we can. And I think we bring a pretty high level. Mostly, I wanna ask you a question, which maybe I should have asked you before we got on the air. 

How much podcast do you listen to a week? 

[00:29:57] Kenshin:

Oh, it varies a number of hours. It varies a lot. I mean, I definitely listen to Formula one after a race. Okay. So that can be I I say that but because it can be from one to two hours a week, that's formula one. But if there is no race, I don't listen to anything formula one related. So it can be two weeks that I don't listen to those two hours. Okay. So that's why that's a bit big for me. 

[00:30:27] McIntosh:

Well, I meant specifically, like, show prep type podcast that you could conceivably pull something from, like, say, Jack Jack. Like John Mallers, for example. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not much. A one hour a week, let's say. See, I should have asked you beforehand. Yeah. Like the Jack Mallers. 



[00:30:48] Kenshin:

But that that's the only one, I would say. 

[00:30:51] McIntosh:

I listen to a lot. I probably because I listen to it while I work sometimes. It quite frequently. I listen to it whenever I'm in the car by myself. Yeah. There are a number of situations where I'm listening to a podcast, and quite typically, it's something that's Bitcoin related or at least Bitcoin adjacent. The only podcast I listen to that's not actually even indirectly related would be, token podcasts that I listen to. I won't. You guys know Lord of the Rings Oh, yeah. J r r Tolkien. I'm a Tolkien nut, and, I can't help myself. So it's kinda like your Formula One podcast. 



[00:31:36] Kenshin:

Is that your guilty pleasure? 

[00:31:39] McIntosh:

No. I wouldn't go that far. Boy, that has some really weird overtones to it. Okay. 

[00:31:46] Kenshin:

No. It's okay. So, okay. Curious question. How many hours a week would you say you listen to podcasts? At least ten. At least ten. Okay. At least ten. 

[00:32:00] McIntosh:

And I am specifically looking at adding some more podcast to my rotation that would directly be beneficial. So I came across a macroeconomics podcast, for example, that I'm about to add to my rotation. Right. And and that is stuff that many times goes directly into our content. 

[00:32:25] Kenshin:

Okay? Right. I have I have another one now I remembered. 

What's this guy's name? David Lin. David Lin Report. It's a bit economics. It's it's not Bitcoin only. Of course not. It's a lot with economics. They bring up Bitcoin here and there. They bring up even other coins. Unfortunately, he has, he always has, people interviewing. So he might bring like, I don't know, a Solana person or something. So I don't listen to those, but they talk a lot about gold, and economics and the market going up or down or whatever. So that I listened to that could help this. 

[00:33:13] McIntosh:

Okay. I feel like really to provide the the best quality product, we do need to do more show prep. And, again, that kinda comes back to money. 

I can't ask you to do more than you're already doing if I can't pay you to do that. And right now, there's no pay. There's no pay for either one of us. So okay. You know, there are people who do this full time. That's all they do, and they get on their podcast and, you know, that's why they sound so prepared. Right? Yeah. We can't do that. Yeah. I try and almost, like, thread it into my everyday life just so that I know I can prepare along the way as I was just explaining. But there's just only a there's only so much we can do with that. That would definitely be something that that we that would enable us to do things like run those clips of, like, Christian Lagarde. Right? Like we were talking about or Christine. Sorry. 

Man, I do not need the president of the ECB mad at me. Yeah. No. I don't. I apologize. Okay. I we got a couple more. Yeah. 

[00:34:25] Kenshin:

So one And so let's go ahead and yeah. One more is a more technical content. We did a bit last week that we talked about the bear and bull markets and looking at more statistics and patterns. I think those are fun. I like to look at the patterns and, and some charts 

[00:34:46] McIntosh:

and not really There's a lot of our listeners that are not into charting, so to speak. That's part of it, but I also would love to do more, like, how to set up a a Bitcoin pay server. A BTC pay server is what it's called. 

Yeah. For small business. Right? Yeah. And and I'm not sure that would be good podcast content, but maybe it would be best to do that as a video or kind of a special episode or whatever, 

[00:35:18] Kenshin:

that would be available. Yeah. Or or we review a licensing wallet or Bitcoin wallet. There you go. Yeah. Nodes that we have talked about nodes before, right, and differences and some wallets and differences. So 

[00:35:32] McIntosh:

yeah, we can do that with the kind of stuff that we're talking about. But that you know, audio is hard enough. When you start talking about editing video, you're talking about even more work. So that's definitely but, again, that's gonna bring improvements to to the platform, to our brand or whatever. 

Whatever you marketing people call it. He's the marketing guy, not me. Just so everybody's clear on that. Okay. Is that we've already done the posting. No? Yeah. Maybe none clips? Or okay. We already did that. So I think that's actually everything. 

[00:36:10] Kenshin:

Oh, yeah. Yeah. We did about posting more clips on Oster, but what about general notes? Yeah. More notes. More, 

[00:36:24] McIntosh:

Not just reposting other people's content. That's something that I'm guilty of, quite a bit, really. I don't post a whole lot of new stuff. I've actually tried to train myself not to do that, and it's just it's just hard. It's hard, especially when other people come up with clever things. 

Yeah. Okay. So those are some of the ways that we're talking about how we can improve. We're looking at, like, a dozen different things. There are 10 different things there. There's a lot of stuff. We've taught quite a bit about the value for value thing. Like I said, I have said historically, I'm not going to get sponsors for the show or advertisers. To be honest, I think if we're going to continue to grow, we're going to have to look at that. So I wanna talk about that for just a minute. I talked to chat GPT, and it was overwhelmingly positive as it always is. 

But it did give me some ideas with our current level. I believe that we actually have the ability, if we can find a sponsor, and we're gonna talk about that in just a second, to generate about a $100 an episode, that they would pay. And that money would go a long way towards helping a lot of this stuff or, I believe, at least getting us to kind of the next level. We need, you know, we need more listeners. We need more stuff. We need more time to do this stuff and all of that kind of stuff like we were just talking about. But having even a supporter at a $100 a week, essentially, I think would take a big burden off of a lot of this. 

So that's kind of, I guess, what we've arrived at. Is that correct, Kenshin? I don't ever wanna put words into your mouth, but is is that Yeah. I mean, it's it's a traditional 

[00:38:36] Kenshin:

way to go. And if it's a viable option, then why not? We can at least try. We try to value for value. 

[00:38:46] McIntosh:

Right. And I look. We're not stopping that. I for one thing, I love the feedback we get from our listeners. Okay? I'd they're awesome. But, anyways, I we're not saying that we're stopping that. But if we start talking about a sponsor, then the question becomes who. And, unfortunately, due to my ethical concerns, and I think you share a lot of those, Kenshin, it's a very small pool. 

I'm not gonna bring on a hardware manufacturer of of Bitcoin wallets like Ledger. I'm not gonna do it. I liter and I said I've said this all a a lot. I'm not even gonna do the one that I use, SeedSigner. As much as I like SeedSigner and as open as they are and they're Bitcoin only and all of that kind of stuff, if they even had a budget, which they do not, I I would say no, seed signer. I I can't do that. I just can't because if you ever have a problem, I'm gonna have trouble talking about that. So we kinda have a very limited range of of companies that we can talk about. We they have to be Bitcoin or they have to be Bitcoin adjacent. 

And it has to be something that we believe in and that we will have no problem coming and talking to you about the audience. And I don't wanna overwhelm everyone with a bunch of ads. We're not gonna be doing that. I would really like to get one sponsor that we say, you know, we're gonna promote their product. I mean, that's the deal. But in return, they're gonna support the show. Yeah. So I guess one thing I wanna ask is if you happen to know somebody or some company or whatever, a contact at a company that would really kind of you feel like would fit that bill, please reach out and let us know. Mhmm. Yeah. It would have to be nice. Relevant 

[00:41:00] Kenshin:

to Bitcoin topic and relevant to the audience and not, as you said, mattresses or or whatever 

[00:41:08] McIntosh:

else. 

But there are some interesting things. We were talking about SoapMiner previously, and I know they're already sponsoring another show, and I'm not even gonna reach out to them. But just as an example, they what's the word? Well, they sell, tallow based soap. So this is made from beef tallow and all kinds of other product. And this is something that there's a a significant portion of the Bitcoin audience that that is something that they would really like. And the show that I'm thinking of, they do it in a respectful manner. They, you know, talk about the product and whatever, and and all that. So, you know, are they a Bitcoin covenant? Well, they're Bitcoin only. 

Actually, they they only take Bitcoin for payment. So, you know, that's something that I could get behind. Unfortunately, they're probably not available and and all that. But Yeah. 

[00:42:10] Kenshin:

I don't know. It's a very small pool of companies that we could support because we we cannot support any wallet or any exchange because you never know what happens and and we don't want to put people's money at the I can't even say, 

[00:42:28] McIntosh:

like, let's say, a a a hosting company, a minor hosting company. Like, I use, bit bit bit. Oh, gosh. I can't believe I I'm drawing a complete blank on their name. It starts with bit. Bitcap. 

Okay? They've been around forever. But to be honest, I was with Kaboomrax prior to Bitcap. Bit and Kaboomrax was great until they weren't. And if they're over there paying me even $400 a month to shill Kaboomrax, It that's a big ethical problem when they start having problems that I see, and I and I'm gonna get on the show for $400 a month and say, well, man, Kaboom racks is the best. They got these fancy yellow power cables and cheap power and the best support even though it was weeks sometime for me to get somebody to fix something. Right? 

So we we have to be so careful. So care I do not wanna come to you guys and say, I'm sorry, guys. That was a bad sponsor. I'm sorry, guys. FTX went down. Right. Exactly. Yeah. 

[00:43:51] Kenshin:

What about and we keep it, re in the recording or not. I don't know. But what about a minor home miner company who does home miners, right? Those little home miners. I would consider that because, yeah, I would Nothing can go really wrong with those. I mean, it's, 

[00:44:10] McIntosh:

no. And and it's No. I mean, they may break, but that's Sure. But I mean, it's electronics. But yeah. You're not gonna get bad, sir. 

[00:44:20] Kenshin:

There I could work with that. And we like to talk about mining from time to time between us anyway. Well So why not? 



[00:44:27] McIntosh:

I mean, I've got all my miners online but one right now, and they're supposed to be looking at that today. Finally. I end up having to consolidate. Never mind. Alright. Start stay on target, Mac and Josh. I I I need more homeowners to warm up my home. You know? So Yes. You do. Especially as it gets cold. Right? Alright. So Kenshin and I, I wanna go over this really quickly. We made some notes, some stuff that we discussed that's adjacent to all this. We are going to have to be talking about ways of promoting this show, whether that's organic, you know, kind of natural, or whether we pay for that, which right now we don't feel like we can because, again, that's just gonna be coming out of our pocket. 

We've already talked about, should I go into number two here? We haven't really talked about this. No. We haven't. Yeah. Go ahead. We have talked about how long are we going willing to do this without, you know, real growth or a sponsor? And the answer is, I think, basically, the May. Okay? That's seven months for now. I hate putting timelines on stuff like this, but I think sometimes that brings action. So that is what we're targeting. We need to have a sponsor in place or be well on that way and seeing significant growth or that kind of thing. Okay? Like I said, we don't really know how to get a sponsor. 

I talked to chat b GBT, and, of course, they they're gonna make me a press kit, and they're gonna make it real easy. And but I know it's not. It's not. So that is that is where we're at right now. We are looking at that. And with the and I'll be happy to discuss numbers with an act with a sponsor or somebody who's interested. But with the level that we're at, we are looking basically a $100 an episode, which quite honestly would really help things out in terms of, you know, funds. So there. Yeah. There's some of these things which Kenshin wrote here that are low hanging fruit. There's things that we can do fairly easily, and I think you'll see those happen pretty quickly. Some of these are gonna take longer, and some of them, frankly, like the people from Africa and South America, it is completely gonna be dependent on getting a sponsor because I cannot, in good conscience, bring on somebody on a regular basis once a month for an hour show without them being paid for that. 



[00:47:12] Kenshin:

Totally agree. We 

[00:47:13] McIntosh:

yeah. Look. Can do I don't want this to be a negative thing. I don't. I have worked this over in my head, and Kenshin and I have talked about it literally for months at this point. And it is time that we just lay it all out, which we just did. This is where we're at. We're gonna pick up the regular content next week and move on. But, you know, we'll give you updates from time to time, but this will be the last time we spend a full episode talking about this kind of stuff. This is kind of the business meeting of Satoshi's plebs, if that's alright with y'all. 

Alright? Sounds good. Hey. We got some support this week Yeah. Which we certainly appreciate. And I again, this isn't a negative on our listeners. I'm that it's not that at all. This is the realities of kind of the economic situation and where Kenshin and I are trying to go with this show. So we did wanna lay that out. Alright. But, yeah, let's I'm gonna do the first one Yeah. I guess, and you can do the second one. So Kano our friend Kano stopped back by this week. I appreciate that, Kano, and boosted 8,888 sets. 

And that is a fun number that I do not know exactly what it goes with, but, hey, it's a great number. 

[00:48:41] Kenshin:

Thank you, Ken. 

[00:48:42] McIntosh:

And he said, or she, I do not know, but regardless said, realized I and the rest of the plebs was cheap last week. Thank you. Short simple message, and let me make sure I got that right. Yep. That's what it said. And I appreciate that, and thank you for your support. 

[00:49:05] Kenshin:

Are you on Nostril? I guess you are a cane. Let us know your, Nostril name. 

[00:49:12] McIntosh:

Yeah. He's yeah. It was a fountain address he sent that from or she. But, yeah, if you're on Nostra, we're we're there. Of course, you can follow us. Yeah. 



[00:49:25] Kenshin:

Next up, we have the bullish clips, 230 sets. And nice to see you again. I love this. Yeah. And he says, say no to the bear market and come check out the bull hashtag bullish market instead. It's a virtual farmers market built with Bitcoin and NoStar. Bookmark the link and set your reminder for the next event at bullishmarket.onrender.com. On render. On render. On render. 

[00:49:58] McIntosh:

It's, 0nnrender.com. Let ladies and gentlemen, that is the way to make an advertisement. Bullish, if you would do some free advertising for us, that'd be terrific. No. I'm just kidding. That's awesome. Alright. 

Yeah. Have you been there, actually? Yeah. I did. And it's, 

[00:50:20] Kenshin:

he has two events coming up. Two monthly events. One is Friday, November 21, and the other one is December 21. 

[00:50:31] McIntosh:

This is not what I was thinking. Okay. So So he's in central time, coming up on November 2. If we can remember, we'll promote it again right before it happens. 

[00:50:43] Kenshin:

And he says visits visit us during schedule events to explore the market. So yeah. 

[00:50:50] McIntosh:

Very cool. That day comes. We'll see. Our question of the week is related to the topic. I would love to hear from y'all. We cannot make decisions based on, you know, one single answer, but it's things that we will take into consideration. 

What would you like to see changed, improved, whatever, for the podcast? And if you have suggestions about a sponsor, that'd be terrific. Okay. Mhmm. I don't really think we got any software news this week or anything along those lines. And I think in terms of show one go ahead. One news I saw somewhere, 

[00:51:29] Kenshin:

there was a solo miner who won. Oh, yes. I saw that. So that was nice. It's always fun. Bunch of beat axies, I think he had, like, 20 of them or something. Yeah. Like, yeah, something like that. Yeah. That's pretty cool. 

[00:51:43] McIntosh:

Alright. 



[00:51:45] Kenshin:

Yep. I I don't have any other news. 

[00:51:50] McIntosh:

Okay. Our Bitcoin price at time of recording here on October 30, $106,885. 

[00:52:01] Kenshin:

And how many euros? And that is around €92,000. 

[00:52:06] McIntosh:

Last October 30, we were sitting at $72,339.54, which means we're up 47.8%. So let's talk very quickly, like one minute, about the market. Last week, we talked quite extensively. This week, we bumped up and bumped right back down, which means we don't really know what's going on. I have something I would like to state, that I believe will factor into this. I'm not fully convinced at this point that we have reached the top of the market. You did a lot of research. I want you to talk about that. But I will say one of the things that I did not bring up last week is it is very apparent The United States is about to start doing what they call quantitative easing, which means more money printing. 

And historically, that shows a flight to real assets like gold and I would argue Bitcoin. Now Mhmm. You did the research. Unlike me who said I was going to, what did you find out about all those numbers we talked about last week? 

[00:53:22] Kenshin:

Well, I did, and I posted it on Noister. And the the original post show notes. Yeah. The original post that that said that predicted, in 2023 predicted the Mhmm. High that we achieved on October 2025. So I did the research to go back and see that, yes, indeed, we're in a ten year pattern, which essentially goes from the low to of one cycle to the high of the next is a hundred and fifty two weeks. Mhmm. From that high to the next low of the next cycle is fifty two weeks. Mhmm. Then a hundred and fifty two weeks, fifty two weeks, and that has gone on and on for the last ten years. So far. And I have all the numbers, all the dates, so far. 

Terrific. So if we do another all time high Right. Anytime now that this pattern is broken. Yeah. If the, if we continue this pattern, it means that we have entered the bear market, which means on October 2026, we will have the lowest of the Right. This coming bear market. We will see. And that's that's the verified pattern after verifying 

[00:54:42] McIntosh:

the numbers myself. I told you this, I think, offline. If we do this, it's going to wreck the miners. There is so much growth right now in the Bitcoin mining space. It is nuts. We passed. You you posted or you sent it to me or whatever. 

We passed one set of hash, and and we went to 1.1 set of hash in, like, a month. It was insane. Yeah. It is the growth right now I mean, that's, like, 10% growth in just a month or two. It took years to get that first point one Zeta Hash, much less. Took ten years. Yeah. And now we did it in a month or two. That's crazy. That's crazy. If the price goes down below the cost of mining a Bitcoin, we're gonna see some public miners blow up, and I'm okay with that. I am perfectly okay with that, by the way. I would love to see it happen, frankly. 

Alright. I don't wanna be mean, but we need something. Alright. Network, one SAP per v byte, 80,000 unprocessed transactions, which is roughly a 170 megabytes. Do you got anything off of Clark's dashboard there you wanna 

[00:56:04] Kenshin:

do? No. No. We can see the next link that has the actual notes. Okay. Okay. So in the notes, we have total 24,000, public public Bitcoin notes. Right. 5,000 of them, meaning 21% is Bitcoin notes and the rest eighteen, nineteen thousand nodes, 78% is Bitcoin core. Okay. So that's what we see from that and we can see that the version 30. 

Yes. Oh, it's already up to 8%. 

[00:56:44] McIntosh:

So 8% of that remaining 70 whatever percent is now No. Of the total. Version 30? 

[00:56:51] Kenshin:

No. Of the total. 

[00:56:54] McIntosh:

Okay. Okay. Well, we'll see. 

[00:56:59] Kenshin:

The notes, the notes 21 29 version is around 15%. 

[00:57:06] McIntosh:

Okay. Alright. Satoshi Splebs is a value for value podcast, supporting podcasting two point o. No ads. No sponsorships. Hey, guys. I we're running late on time, and I'm just gonna go ahead and cut this. We've talked about this. You know where we're at. You can boost us, on Fountain if you would like. The best thing you can do is simply tell somebody about the podcast and get them listening. We need more listeners. 

That's it. This week's music is The Jetsons by Joe Martin. Any boost or streaming of Sats during that song will go straight to, Joe Martin. 

[00:57:48] Kenshin:

Yeah. And this is one of those episodes that we really need, the feedback. Yes. And we'd really appreciate to get your feedback even without boosting it. Yes. Just send us a note or a comment. Yeah. You can comment under our, our post of the episodes in Satosh's Club's account, or send us a direct message or or however you like to reach us. Then we really appreciate what we can do better to improve Yes. Our podcast. So for me, stay humble. This is all set and have a great weekend. 

[00:58:22] McIntosh:

We'll talk to you all soon. Bye bye.
