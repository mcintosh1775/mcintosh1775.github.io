One of this weeks news items is that the bitcoin wallets holding less than one bitcoin ("shrimps") are actually stacking more sats than the entire output of Bitcoin Miners. That is terrific news!!!! It turns out, despite what the press might imply, we don't need corporate funding in order to keep bitcoin adoption moving. The businesses and corporation will come.. nation states will adopt bitcoin and eventually it will be reserve currency of the world. But remember we DO NOT NEED THEM.
