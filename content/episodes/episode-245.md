This week on Satoshi’s Plebs, McIntosh flies solo while Kenshin takes the week off, and uses the downtime to riff on a question that’s been nagging at him: how does AI actually “pay for things” once agents start doing real work in the world? He shares a bit of personal momentum—how fast modern AI tooling is letting him build software—and then pivots into why Bitcoin (especially Lightning, and possibly eCash backed by Bitcoin) feels like the most natural settlement layer for agent-to-agent commerce.

The big theme is that as agents become more autonomous—and as companies demand standards around security, skills, and guardrails—payments can’t stay “free” forever. McIntosh argues that Bitcoin’s divisibility and existing infrastructure make it a strong candidate for the default money of AI-to-AI microtransactions, and he leaves listeners with a question: are you ready for a “Jarvis” doing tasks for you… and do you think those agents will end up transacting in sats?
