Time to dust off the history books. France, along with other European nations, has a long history of involvement with Africa. Much of this history is based on exploitation of both the natural resources and the people of Africa. The direct French involvement did not end in many of these countries until 1960.

This history, and the subsequent treaties established during independence of the African nations during the 1958 - 1960 time period set the stage for the continued economic exploitation of the African continent.
