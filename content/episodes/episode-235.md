McIntosh and Kenshin explore the dangerous world of "fiat games" and their consequences across global markets. They discuss Cardano's spectacular collapse after an AI-assisted coding error split the blockchain, triggering FBI involvement, and celebrate Texas becoming the first US state to actually purchase Bitcoin with $5M in iBit ETF. The Federal Reserve's pivot back to quantitative easing with a liquidity injection draws parallels to COVID-era money printing that launched Bitcoin from $3,800 to $29,000. The Japan carry trade unwind takes center stage as rising interest rates force massive deleveraging, with Bitcoin serving as the "canary in coal mine" through overnight liquidations. The episode explores Austrian versus Keynesian economics and sobering statistics from https://wtfhappenedin1971.com showing how abandoning the gold standard distorted everything from housing affordability (average first-time buyer now age 40) to soup prices—proving that playing fiat games only wins you fiat prizes.
