This week we are going to slow down a little. No technical talk! Instead I'm going to describe the biggest mistake I have made in cryptocurrency since 2014. It's easy to get swept up in a bull market but it's a good time right now to plan what you are going to do during a downturn.

 I can be reached at mcintosh.fintech@gmail.com by email and on twitter at @McIntoshFinTech. Looking forward to hearing from you!
