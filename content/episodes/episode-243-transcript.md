00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.360
Welcome back to Satoshi's Plebs for episode two forty three. I'm Macintosh.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.640
I am Kenshin.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.280
And today, we're talking about Bitcoin multisig.

4
00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:23.925
And once again, sir, you have nailed it. Perfect.

5
00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:25.525
Well, this time.

6
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.920
I'm surprised you didn't you didn't cut the

7
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.240
the intro last week.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.760
90.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.640
That was funny. Very I curious. I was like, what am I going to hear now?

10
00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.454
I just updated by the way.

11
00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.774
Yeah. Wow. That's true. I just updated

12
00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:48.454
our block count.

13
00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:50.614
Somebody turned on some hash power.

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.489
Just in the last

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.210
ten minutes, let's go back ten minutes, we've mined four blocks.

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.770
So we are actually at 834890

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.050
excuse

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.634
me. We are at block height nine three four eight nine zero as we start recording. Right.

19
00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:13.954
Crazy.

20
00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:16.915
But we'll get back to that in a minute.

21
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:18.914
How are you, sir?

22
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.760
Good. Oh, wow. I jumped things. You know what? We're gonna start doing the block heights right out of the bat because I just

23
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.080
I it's just what I do.

24
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.400
I don't know. What can I say?

25
00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:36.115
Why fight? Anyways, what's going on with you, sir?

26
00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:37.715
Well,

27
00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:38.835
as always,

28
00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:41.075
still freezing here in Sweden.

29
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.595
Not as always. During the summer, it's nice.

30
00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.170
Yeah.

31
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.770
Sure. It's raining.

32
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.850
That's recent. Now

33
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.090
it's minus 10 the whole week. So,

34
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.265
yeah, the house is struggling to keep heating. It's more cold coming from outside than heat

35
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:07.625
that we generate from inside, so it's dropping every day inside temperature.

36
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.785
But, yeah, that's not so interesting, I guess.

37
00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:12.665
Well,

38
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.180
I don't know about that.

39
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.900
I mean that's life.

40
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.500
Yeah. Right?

41
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.660
Did I ever tell you I don't think I've ever told you my

42
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.100
in laws

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.500
went to Sweden a few years ago.

44
00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:28.815
Okay.

45
00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:40.815
And during the summer, mind you. They really liked it. Of course, I've never been there. This has been a number of years ago now, I guess. You get older, I don't know, whatever. It's a time dilation event, that's all I know.

46
00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:45.300
It's probably been ten years But my father-in-law went

47
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.740
salmon fishing,

48
00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.660
they went and saw reindeer.

49
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.500
They had a good time.

50
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.620
Good It's it's good. Nature is really nice around here.

51
00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.475
I would think, if you were an outdoor person someplace like Sweden or Norway

52
00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:09.555
during the summer and I mean if you like the cold or if you can handle the cold even during the winter I mean you can get out and ski and

53
00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.620
Yeah. I don't know, snowshoe and all kinds of snowmobile,

54
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.180
whatever.

55
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060
Yeah. I went up to the very

56
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.820
the very north of Sweden. You can do Duxley.

57
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.099
Duxley Oh, that'd be sweet. In the in the forest.

58
00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:28.205
And when I did it once, they told us

59
00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:31.165
it was in the winter, and they told us,

60
00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:36.685
you feel the temperature. You know what temperature it is because of the eyelashes

61
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:39.725
start to freeze at minus 30 degrees Celsius.

62
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.180
So we went out to the forest and we felt it and we said, okay. Did your eyelashes freeze?

63
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500
It's like time to go back inside. Have you ever seen a moose?

64
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.540
Yeah. Even here in my garden.

65
00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:55.325
Really?

66
00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:56.445
Yeah.

67
00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.205
They come around, they live around. Was it a bull or was

68
00:04:00.765 --> 00:04:04.045
it male or female? Do you know? Do you have antlers?

69
00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:05.485
We've

70
00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.245
seen with and without.

71
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.620
We've seen both. And the young one we've seen.

72
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.980
So the bull, the males,

73
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.020
they have the big antlers. Females do not. Yeah. Exactly. I have never had it but I have heard frankly that

74
00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:24.195
mousse is good eating.

75
00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.675
I would be willing to try.

76
00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:29.315
Especially if it was in my garden.

77
00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:31.075
I bet it made a mess.

78
00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.795
They like the apples. So they come under the apple tree and they eat the apples.

79
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.030
Apple flavored mousse. What more do you want? Yeah. I mean, just

80
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.310
Anyways,

81
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.390
I I just offended probably 10% of the audience. I'm sorry.

82
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.270
We don't have enough audience to be offending.

83
00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:54.685
Maybe I should act this maybe should be what I should think about.

84
00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:57.325
So you offended three people.

85
00:04:58.685 --> 00:04:59.485
Careful now.

86
00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:01.085
Alright.

87
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.885
So what else has been going on? Surely there's more than that.

88
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.540
Oh,

89
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.260
let me see. Well,

90
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.580
it was the first ever time we went to the lake,

91
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.460
the frozen lake here next to our house to do some ice skating.

92
00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:22.965
At least my son did. Yeah. That's awesome.

93
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:30.725
Yeah. That was an experience. That was really fun. Was walking on the ice, of course. Now I don't like skated or walked.

94
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:32.805
Yeah. I don't like the

95
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.090
Sorry. No.

96
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.890
I prefer the long long shoes or skis, you know. I don't like the short ones. Okay. Mhmm.

97
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.570
I've only been ice skating once and it was a disaster.

98
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.695
Something about my ankles. They just don't wanna do that. I don't know. It just doesn't work.

99
00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:59.574
No. But it was a good time for my son. Good. So Yeah. Quite fun. Take him every winter.

100
00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:04.140
He will have good memory. I'm serious. He will have good memories of that.

101
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.540
Yeah. Yeah. Now we can go and do it every weekend basically.

102
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.500
It's only

103
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.100
two minutes away.

104
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.980
Yeah.

105
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.580
Yeah.

106
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.980
But we want to go skiing also.

107
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.260
Okay. Maybe maybe not this weekend but next.

108
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:26.515
And that will be the first time again for my son. So That's That will be interesting.

109
00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:35.235
Passed all the firsts for all my kids and it's kinda well, no. That's not true. I've still got one who hasn't driven yet.

110
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.490
Oh.

111
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.289
But that's it. Well and moved out.

112
00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.210
But that's it. Alright.

113
00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:45.370
So

114
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.810
I

115
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.969
was a little surprised.

116
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.115
Told me you had not installed

117
00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:54.915
what is it called Moltster.

118
00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:59.315
I don't know it's had like three names. The new

119
00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:01.155
artificial intelligence

120
00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:02.115
agent

121
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.590
Mhmm.

122
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:04.790
Clawster?

123
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.190
Claw

124
00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.270
Claw Claw I

125
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.430
don't know. But do you know what I'm talking about?

126
00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.110
I'm not sure but I saw some funny

127
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.035
looking up. Yeah. This

128
00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:27.275
was it the clawed boat or something? Clawed boat. Yes. Open claw is another name for it. As in c l a w

129
00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:31.915
like as in a lobster claw. So it's all a play on lobster.

130
00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:37.980
Right? And it's this dumb agent. Well, it's not dumb. It's actually not. But I was honestly

131
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.340
a little shocked you hadn't been playing with that.

132
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:51.265
You're busy doing other things. Yes. I'm not gonna change my setup right now. It's very delicate. That's a really good idea.

133
00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:54.465
That's a really good idea. I

134
00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:59.104
can start and I told you this also that I'm so into

135
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.620
trying to go live now

136
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.620
Mhmm. These these days, these weeks. So I I don't pay attention to anything else.

137
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.860
Right. So I will be free to experiment and play with stuff again.

138
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.620
Maybe in a month.

139
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.060
That's a good plan.

140
00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:16.885
That's a good plan.

141
00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:18.245
Okay?

142
00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:23.525
What did I do this week?

143
00:08:23.845 --> 00:08:25.925
I did not play with open claw.

144
00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:31.700
I really wanted to. So I came across it on YouTube

145
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.180
when I was watching some other videos,

146
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.500
more normal, fair,

147
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:49.945
about a week ago. And in the AI space, people started it it just all of a sudden just boom. It's just like everybody's talking about this OpenClaw. And it literally has had like three names. Claude

148
00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:57.145
AI got mad at them and sent them like a a trademark notice or whatever and they had to change their name.

149
00:08:57.545 --> 00:08:58.505
But it's like this,

150
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:06.320
it's a it's an AI agent that's fairly easily programmed. You can set it up and actually communicate

151
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.279
with like,

152
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.520
with it through

153
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.160
Slack or WhatsApp

154
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.279
or

155
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:20.404
maybe iMessage. I'm not I'm not sure but it can do all kinds of stuff like it'll read your email

156
00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:25.045
if you want it. I mean you have to give it what they call skills.

157
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:31.190
You have to give it permissions and code to do this But then it almost becomes this little

158
00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:39.750
kind of self aware organism. It's it's not, but it's kind of freaky. I mean, I I've watched these a number of videos about this.

159
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.790
But I'll I'll say all that and then I'll tell you, please

160
00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:48.704
be very careful about this. This is a it's a brand new project.

161
00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:54.945
Like the creator of the project literally did it so fast because he was like using

162
00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:55.505
multiple

163
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.380
AI bots agents himself to write the code.

164
00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:03.420
He had he literally has said in an interview,

165
00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.339
I haven't not read all the code. He he just doesn't.

166
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.700
And

167
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.139
so

168
00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:12.574
it's a security issue.

169
00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:17.055
It's also a security issue in these unvetted

170
00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:19.214
skills.

171
00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:30.230
I saw one and you have to take this stuff with a grain of salt. It's the Internet. But there was one company that security company said they did like a analysis

172
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.870
of the skills repository

173
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.390
and 13%

174
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.190
of them were malicious essentially

175
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.550
in some manner.

176
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.510
Okay?

177
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.535
So that's not good.

178
00:10:43.735 --> 00:10:44.855
There but

179
00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:51.815
tools like these I believe will be a part of our future whether we like it or not. Yeah. I mean,

180
00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:54.774
you you will simply communicate

181
00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:55.894
with your

182
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.210
with your computer

183
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:07.010
which in addition to running the OS will have one or more AI agents running on it at any one time

184
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.650
doing things like scheduling your appointments.

185
00:11:10.785 --> 00:11:12.385
I've seen some like

186
00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:17.105
the things that these things do are fascinating. I saw one

187
00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:20.305
post they were talking about

188
00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:24.785
they wanted the AI agent, the Claude Bot or whatever

189
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.950
to book a dinner appointment.

190
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.590
Okay? A dinner reservation.

191
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:37.270
Yeah. And it realized it could not do it through OpenTable which is a reservation

192
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.925
program. Right. Yeah. For whatever reason. So it built

193
00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.645
or utilized

194
00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:48.485
a voice, an AI voice program to call

195
00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:50.404
the restaurant

196
00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.084
make the reservation.

197
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.150
Similar to what Google was doing.

198
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.790
That is like freaky level stuff.

199
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.710
It's

200
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.430
it's

201
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:06.830
aware enough that it realized I can't do this so I'm gonna go over here and figure out another way to do it.

202
00:12:07.904 --> 00:12:11.745
I mean think about that and the implications that I I

203
00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:23.930
don't know and I don't know how we control these but I'm I'm fully convinced that this is what's coming down the road. You know, we're gonna be using these for coding. We're gonna be using these to to

204
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:31.850
you could do so many things like if you had controllable house lighting you could just tell the bot, hey, turn off all the lights in the house.

205
00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:41.015
Turn down the lights in this room. Turn up this speaker. Do this, do that. There's so many things. It's the limitations are only

206
00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:43.415
essentially put on by ourselves.

207
00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:46.215
It's not a limitation of the agent.

208
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.680
So

209
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.200
fascinating stuff. Now they've built their own networks,

210
00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.680
their own social networks.

211
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.680
I saw that. Have you heard of the MOLT MOLT book? M o l t like a

212
00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:05.515
Have you been there? Didn't try No. I just No. I

213
00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:10.555
am afraid to stare into the face of our dystopian future.

214
00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:11.915
But

215
00:13:12.635 --> 00:13:15.355
these agents are getting together

216
00:13:15.515 --> 00:13:17.115
on a social media

217
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.730
platform that that they built. It's crazy.

218
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.410
Yeah.

219
00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:32.209
Yeah. Yeah. I I don't know. I just I just didn't have time, but I saw it on Oster yesterday night. They they were mentioning some some links.

220
00:13:33.575 --> 00:13:34.535
I don't think

221
00:13:35.175 --> 00:13:41.815
I I may end up building one of these just for testing in a very controlled environment at this point. I don't feel like

222
00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:43.175
this

223
00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:52.279
open claw or whatever is like the be all to end all. I don't think this is where we're gonna end up. There has to be a better model in terms of security.

224
00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:53.399
But

225
00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:57.720
but I was telling my wife the other day, I said,

226
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.635
it's a good thing nobody from my work listens to this podcast.

227
00:14:02.115 --> 00:14:04.355
Well, I actually told my boss this.

228
00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:05.395
I said

229
00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:12.195
I said, I'd be honest, I'd much rather be doing all this other stuff that I'm working on instead of this job.

230
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.620
I mean it's to that point. This stuff is fascinating to me.

231
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.420
Yeah. You know? Because I do believe we are at an inflection point and I'm not saying I know the future.

232
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.220
Mhmm. You know who Marc Andreessen is?

233
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.755
No. The guy who like created

234
00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.395
the web browser Netscape?

235
00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:36.275
Not doesn't ring a bell? Say

236
00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.515
the name again? Mark

237
00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.275
Andreessen.

238
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:47.710
No. No. Okay. Well, he literally created the web browser so you can thank him for HTML.

239
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.510
He's

240
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:57.550
he's turned into kinda because he's become a big investor, he's made billions of dollars, whatever.

241
00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:02.565
Now he's like this futurist. He just sits around and thinks about all this mess.

242
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:05.285
And I saw him on a podcast,

243
00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:09.045
on an AI podcast, and they were talking about this stuff and,

244
00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:11.125
you know, I don't know, it's just

245
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.880
I don't think any of us really know where this is going.

246
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.120
And I'm not even willing to say at this point it's going to be great or it's going to be terrible.

247
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.040
It will probably be a mix.

248
00:15:25.274 --> 00:15:26.315
But man,

249
00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:33.515
it is we are at an inflection point. There is no doubt. And it's not that LLMs are the be all to end all.

250
00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.115
But what if

251
00:15:36.154 --> 00:15:39.490
well here's one of the things. I mean they've got theoretical

252
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:45.890
research models out there showing that maybe they can do these LLMs with like one tenth

253
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.290
the compute power that they do now. So

254
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.970
what does that mean? Oh, I've got an LLM on my phone.

255
00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:57.955
Yeah. But I mean they're horrible.

256
00:15:57.955 --> 00:15:59.075
I I tried.

257
00:15:59.555 --> 00:16:03.555
So I've hosted a few of those that are 1.5. That's

258
00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:07.154
not what I'm talking about. This is stuff that's not it's not

259
00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:11.130
been done out in the world yet. It's in the research So

260
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.930
you mean the size that we are containing the big ones?

261
00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:18.009
So

262
00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:19.209
a trillion

263
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.130
what do they call it? Is it tokens? A trillion token model

264
00:16:23.425 --> 00:16:25.265
is super

265
00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:25.985
large.

266
00:16:26.225 --> 00:16:28.225
That's like the best of the best.

267
00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:34.065
What if instead of a trillion, what if it was one tenth that size but the same power?

268
00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:37.505
That means you could run on much lower hardware.

269
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.050
Sure.

270
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.890
It will happen. It will

271
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.730
take ten years.

272
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.170
Do you think? I

273
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.570
would make a bet on that right there. I'm dead serious because I don't think so.

274
00:16:51.755 --> 00:16:59.195
But still, I mean, it's like we say now the the space shadow was running on computers that were less powerful than your phone.

275
00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:03.755
Correct. And now we have phones that are more powerful than the space shadow. But,

276
00:17:04.075 --> 00:17:05.515
yeah. Yeah. It will happen.

277
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.360
It will change some stuff.

278
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.120
Sure.

279
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.960
But for example, I I run Hey. I don't wanna turn this into the AI podcast.

280
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.680
Right. But

281
00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:25.184
we'll see is all I know. Yeah. Yeah. So I did get one project

282
00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.504
over the MVP line this morning actually.

283
00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:35.585
Okay. So I'm pretty proud of that. I'm ready. I'm working on

284
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.070
on speed at this point. It's slow

285
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.070
and so it takes like eighty seconds to return the results but the results are good.

286
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:44.110
Okay?

287
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:50.504
So this is my rag model, I think I've mentioned this before. It's basically specialized information

288
00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:52.664
dumped into a vector database

289
00:17:52.745 --> 00:17:59.784
and then you query that and query the LLM and then use the LLM power to pull together everything essentially.

290
00:18:00.184 --> 00:18:03.784
I've already got some suggestions from chat GPT

291
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:13.669
about things we can do that should make that significantly less. So now I'm in the let's speed this up stage even though to be honest, given what it actually does,

292
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:25.764
I could just put it out there and say here, go do it. Yeah. Because the results aren't that good. Yeah. You told me you're flying. Yeah. That was a good Yep. No. It's it's I'm very happy with that and it was a cool

293
00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:27.524
introduction to

294
00:18:27.684 --> 00:18:30.005
how to do these specialized

295
00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:30.485
builds.

296
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.399
So I'm I'm basically

297
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:39.479
I'm not done done with it but I I made I reached a major milestone. I'm I'm very happy about that. That was

298
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.159
a good bit of my week

299
00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:44.279
outside of the normal rigmarole of

300
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.080
work.

301
00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:48.144
Nice. So that was good.

302
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:54.144
That was good. Alright. What are we talking about today, sir? We need to move this on or we're just gonna have to relabel the podcast.

303
00:18:54.385 --> 00:18:55.104
Yeah.

304
00:18:55.505 --> 00:18:58.625
No. I think we're talking about multiple signatures.

305
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.280
What if we talked about how the AI agents are gonna start using Satoshis to pay each other for task?

306
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.200
I mean, I'm just saying it's coming.

307
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.054
Yeah. There's no better form of okay. Sorry.

308
00:19:11.855 --> 00:19:17.615
And then I was about to reply to it. Yeah. Because I I I use one to pay with Satoshi's

309
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:23.534
to pay for an AI. That that was really good. You mean to pay for the service of the AI?

310
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.710
Yeah.

311
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:33.990
So what I'm this is even beyond that. I'm saying the AI because they'll delegate tasks to each other. That's one of the things that Cloudbot does.

312
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:42.504
They will literally say, okay, this is worth a 100 satoshis. Boom. Done. Go do it. Okay. This is you know, and and you'll budget it. Right?

313
00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:48.744
Yeah. And it'll come right out of your lightning wallet or come back to your lightning wallet if you wrote that agent.

314
00:19:50.424 --> 00:19:51.225
Saying.

315
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:54.025
You know, there was a team in India

316
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.609
and you thought you were querying an AI

317
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:59.489
and it was actually You were just querying the people.

318
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.409
Yeah. Stuff's

319
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:02.369
gonna go on.

320
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:03.729
Yeah.

321
00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:09.134
Why why are there grifters in the world? I don't know because people don't have

322
00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.414
a conscience.

323
00:20:11.135 --> 00:20:18.815
Mhmm. Let's not turn this into a philosophy podcast. Alright. We're already covering AI and Bitcoin. So I think we got enough.

324
00:20:19.775 --> 00:20:22.335
Bitcoin and AI. Let's at least say it that way.

325
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.769
Yeah. What

326
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.730
are we talking about? What actually is our main topic? We really yeah. We're

327
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.970
hey. We did better than last week.

328
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.650
I see. Yeah. Less than 20. Okay. Mhmm.

329
00:20:36.274 --> 00:20:37.235
Bitcoin

330
00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:38.195
multisig.

331
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.474
Right. Mhmm.

332
00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:42.754
What is Bitcoin multisig?

333
00:20:44.434 --> 00:20:50.274
What is so, yeah, we wanna start there. This is a topic maybe that scares some people.

334
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.259
Maybe they don't know what we're talking about right now.

335
00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:56.179
Just relax.

336
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.139
This is not something you're gonna do overnight,

337
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.379
but

338
00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:03.620
it is something

339
00:21:04.855 --> 00:21:11.575
I think it should I both hold the belief. We do both hold the belief that long term Bitcoin's gonna go up in value.

340
00:21:11.894 --> 00:21:14.774
You know, we talk about the market and this, that, and the other.

341
00:21:15.255 --> 00:21:15.815
But,

342
00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:18.134
in long term,

343
00:21:18.375 --> 00:21:18.855
Bitcoin,

344
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:21.629
I believe, I'll say this,

345
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:26.190
is going to become the world reserve currency. I think it will be used for the predominant

346
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.029
trades between nations

347
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:34.350
and maybe we're fifty years from that. But I do believe it's coming. I believe people all over the world will be using it.

348
00:21:37.185 --> 00:21:42.625
A big part of Bitcoin is what's called self custody. Do you wanna explain that, Kenshin?

349
00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:46.305
Yeah. Self custody is when you have,

350
00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:47.665
control

351
00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:50.759
of the keys of your Bitcoin.

352
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.999
Okay. Essentially,

353
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080
you don't rely on institution

354
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.240
or a bank or a company or a service to

355
00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:03.385
safeguard

356
00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.225
the signatures,

357
00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:10.745
basically, of of your Bitcoin because Right. Yeah. I don't want to say the wallets,

358
00:22:10.745 --> 00:22:12.184
really, because it's

359
00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:16.905
essentially what all those Bitcoin wallets that we have. They just safeguard

360
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.450
the signature key,

361
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.210
essentially a password

362
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.610
with which you can

363
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:29.250
sign the transactions and move Bitcoin around that proves it is yours. They're not really wallets.

364
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:42.794
They're really password managers. Is that a correct assumption? Yeah. Yeah. I I I think it's closer to that than Yeah. It's a better way Yeah. Doing Yeah. So we we won't even call them hardware wallets. We'll call them password managers.

365
00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.234
Yeah. I like that.

366
00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:46.474
Yeah. I like that. Yeah.

367
00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:48.715
So so

368
00:22:48.100 --> 00:23:00.659
if I got my coins on Coinbase, it's not in my custody. It's in their custody. No. Yeah. And they're controlling it. And that means things that, you know, we've talked about in the past. It means you could lose your Bitcoin

369
00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:07.054
in short. Yeah. Okay? Or not have control of it or not. It'd be take a

370
00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:08.975
long period of time to get it.

371
00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:13.215
So when we talk about self custody, we talk about

372
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.590
password managers, hardware wallets like we said that are

373
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.109
one person. Hey, I'm gonna key in the password.

374
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:28.830
Boom. There's the account. Essentially, there's the Bitcoin and I have control of them. I can do what I need to.

375
00:23:29.595 --> 00:23:33.195
Another way of doing this is multi sing.

376
00:23:33.434 --> 00:23:35.115
And instead of one,

377
00:23:35.275 --> 00:23:38.634
you have more than one signature that's required.

378
00:23:39.035 --> 00:23:40.315
Does that make sense?

379
00:23:40.715 --> 00:23:41.115
Yes.

380
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.000
Okay. So we're not gonna be telling you, hey, you should go out and buy this setup

381
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.679
or that setup or whatever. We're going to describe

382
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.200
what multisig

383
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.640
is. We're gonna talk about why you would wanna do that

384
00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:57.094
And

385
00:23:57.095 --> 00:24:01.815
we're going to kind of lay it all out there for you. You make the decision,

386
00:24:02.134 --> 00:24:02.774
you know,

387
00:24:03.414 --> 00:24:04.374
very

388
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:11.749
few people start with a multisig setup because it is more complex, it requires more knowledge, and it takes more time.

389
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.549
And if you've only got a few dollars of Bitcoin,

390
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.629
then you're not gonna go through that trouble or the expense.

391
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.830
Right? Yeah.

392
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:24.150
And then, of course, it's not only

393
00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:25.885
the knowledge,

394
00:24:26.125 --> 00:24:27.325
as

395
00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:30.765
you said the expense that you need but also

396
00:24:31.325 --> 00:24:32.685
you mitigate

397
00:24:32.685 --> 00:24:48.230
risk by having a multisig but you also introduce new type of risk with complexity I would say. So we can talk about all of this. Alright. Before we jump into that, let's talk about the issues that you actually would have with a single signature setup.

398
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.150
Alright?

399
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.355
So with a signal set up, you've got one key

400
00:24:54.515 --> 00:24:56.195
and it is

401
00:24:56.435 --> 00:24:58.595
controlling all of your Bitcoin

402
00:24:58.835 --> 00:24:59.635
whatever.

403
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:02.355
It is a single point of failure.

404
00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:06.355
Yes. Alright? How can we

405
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.830
what can happen? Are there some things that can happen, Kenshin? Yeah. I mean, you can just lose it.

406
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.590
Mhmm. You for example, you can just write it in a piece of paper and that piece of paper gets

407
00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:21.174
I lost my seed phrase

408
00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:23.575
to my password to

409
00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:25.894
mount Gox.

410
00:25:26.535 --> 00:25:27.414
Oh, really?

411
00:25:27.975 --> 00:25:29.494
No. I don't know that.

412
00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:33.910
Uh-huh. They said I don't have any on there, but I tried.

413
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.550
I did have a Mt. Doc's account. Anyway, sorry.

414
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.110
Yeah. You it can certainly happen.

415
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.950
Yeah. Mhmm.

416
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.630
Yeah. I mean, it can get

417
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.870
and if you have one

418
00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:49.264
key or one device, it can even get stolen, of course. Right.

419
00:25:50.145 --> 00:25:52.385
That's my biggest fear that someone

420
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:58.785
comes to you also and threatens you, and you have the one key and you are forced to give it away.

421
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:00.539
So Right.

422
00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:02.779
Yeah. Theft,

423
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.299
the loss,

424
00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:05.899
stolen.

425
00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:07.419
What else do we have?

426
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.179
Malware could

427
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.195
Fire. Exactly. That's two. But there are other Malware is good. Yeah.

428
00:26:14.835 --> 00:26:19.075
Yeah. But fire, can mitigate also with how you store it.

429
00:26:19.554 --> 00:26:24.115
Right. So you can if you have one key, you should at least store it in a metal plate.

430
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.620
Or in a fireproof safe, although that's a level of

431
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.460
trust, essentially.

432
00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.860
Most safes are rated to a certain amount, like so many hours at such and such a temperature.

433
00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:42.135
Did you know that? No. I didn't actually.

434
00:26:44.215 --> 00:26:46.855
You need a safe in case you didn't have Well,

435
00:26:48.855 --> 00:26:54.710
you put the metal seed plate in a safe. Mhmm. You could do that. Yep. That would even be better.

436
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.669
Yeah.

437
00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:57.269
That's true.

438
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.550
But, yeah, then you have all this with malware and social engineering

439
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.590
and coercion.

440
00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:10.875
So a lot of different ways mess up. Yeah. A lot of different ways to to steal your seed phrase.

441
00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:16.075
I had something happen to me one time, and this did happen. This isn't just me saying this.

442
00:27:17.299 --> 00:27:21.539
And I'm not exactly sure of what would have happened if I messed up.

443
00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:32.020
But with the Ledger Wallet, which was the original device that I got long before I knew not to ever buy Ledger, people do not do it. It's a don't. Just don't. Trust me.

444
00:27:33.394 --> 00:27:34.354
Anyways,

445
00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:39.315
I had some stuff on there and I went to move it off and you have to put in a PIN,

446
00:27:40.034 --> 00:27:41.554
a PIN number

447
00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:42.994
and

448
00:27:43.315 --> 00:27:44.595
I didn't know the PIN number.

449
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:55.809
Oh. And after three times it resets. Oh, right. So I don't know what that actually meant. I think it meant I would have lost my funds.

450
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:56.769
Yeah.

451
00:27:59.505 --> 00:28:01.585
Not a bad not a good design,

452
00:28:02.225 --> 00:28:02.705
really.

453
00:28:04.304 --> 00:28:05.024
Not

454
00:28:05.265 --> 00:28:08.624
and I mean that was you could call that human error,

455
00:28:08.784 --> 00:28:09.105
I guess.

456
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.840
You could've called it a lost seed phrase because I didn't have the seed phrase.

457
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.240
That was the way I was getting in.

458
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.559
May have been a password I put in as well, but I had to get both of them.

459
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.320
I'm pretty sure there was.

460
00:28:24.925 --> 00:28:30.365
So you couldn't remake the the wallet with the CD4? I don't know because I did actually

461
00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:35.325
I well, remember or guess, whatever. I got it right.

462
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.710
So I don't know.

463
00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:43.909
But it was a frightening experience because it said,

464
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.830
I'm gonna reset this device.

465
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.110
Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.390
Yeah. And many times that's actually

467
00:28:50.965 --> 00:28:53.445
good if you have planned it that way.

468
00:28:53.845 --> 00:28:59.925
So you can actually plan it to either put the wrong password on purpose and it resets the device. So

469
00:29:00.325 --> 00:29:03.045
I know some some wallets have that functionality.

470
00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:05.205
So you put a password and then it resets.

471
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:12.190
And that's when you're threatened and you do this. For whatever reason, I was not aware of that. And

472
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.870
when I saw that on the second try

473
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:16.990
Yeah.

474
00:29:17.995 --> 00:29:18.634
No.

475
00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:22.154
I tried it once and it said you got three tries.

476
00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:25.114
Right. And at that point I stopped

477
00:29:25.115 --> 00:29:27.114
and thought about it because

478
00:29:27.674 --> 00:29:28.634
I knew

479
00:29:28.794 --> 00:29:30.075
this could be a bad thing.

480
00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.919
I don't know. Mhmm.

481
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.440
Yep. Okay.

482
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.239
Okay. One

483
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.960
of the biggest conclusions though I think we need to pull from this

484
00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:43.240
is that

485
00:29:44.035 --> 00:29:48.195
most bit and and the study they've done whatever.

486
00:29:48.195 --> 00:29:49.475
This is the reality.

487
00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:52.515
Most Bitcoin losses are self inflicted.

488
00:29:53.555 --> 00:30:01.630
I've got my password out on a desk and a thief steals it or I don't keep my seed phrase in

489
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.669
a safe and my house catches on fire

490
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.710
or

491
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.630
I'm socially

492
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.070
engineered out of it.

493
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.910
I guess that wouldn't be self inflicted to an extent

494
00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:14.155
But,

495
00:30:14.955 --> 00:30:19.355
you know, I lose it because I don't manage it properly.

496
00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:23.914
Alright? Yep. And when we're talking about

497
00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:27.035
if you've owned Bitcoin for a while,

498
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:36.220
let's say you've owned Bitcoin for ten years, it's probably worth hundreds of thousands of dollars at this point. You probably have multiple Bitcoin

499
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.420
because back ten years ago it was I don't even wanna think about what it was.

500
00:30:43.105 --> 00:30:44.304
It was cheap. And

501
00:30:45.184 --> 00:30:46.784
if you've kept it,

502
00:30:47.025 --> 00:30:49.424
at this point it's worth a lot of money.

503
00:30:49.745 --> 00:30:51.664
That's the point. So

504
00:30:51.905 --> 00:30:53.504
you want to

505
00:30:54.304 --> 00:30:55.184
ensure

506
00:30:55.424 --> 00:30:56.225
that

507
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.030
it stays safe.

508
00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.550
Right now,

509
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:08.670
you may not feel like you have a lot and maybe you don't. Maybe you have a thousand dollars. Maybe you have maybe you have $10,000.

510
00:31:09.304 --> 00:31:13.545
I'm sure there are some listeners to this show who have $10,000

511
00:31:13.545 --> 00:31:14.345
that's

512
00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:16.744
basically one tenth of a Bitcoin.

513
00:31:17.705 --> 00:31:18.585
10,000,000

514
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:27.159
Satoshis. It's it's less than that but. Well not anymore. Right? Not anymore. Okay. Don't look. Make this easy for this. Okay?

515
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.600
It's a $100,000 Bitcoin because it's going to be a $100,000 Bitcoin again one day.

516
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.600
And 10,000,000.

517
00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:38.745
Maybe you don't feel like that's a huge amount.

518
00:31:39.225 --> 00:31:43.465
Maybe you've got other investments that are, you know, a lot more or whatever.

519
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:46.585
Ten years from now, what if

520
00:31:46.825 --> 00:31:48.505
that is a $100,000?

521
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.520
Do you just leave a $100,000

522
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.840
laying around on your desk? Of course not.

523
00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:10.884
Wasn't it mister Beast? He had it in a post it note on his laptop. And thieves went to his home and they stole so many things around his laptop and they didn't see They did. The post it note. Oh, man. And he had like a million dollars or something.

524
00:32:11.365 --> 00:32:12.164
Wow.

525
00:32:13.205 --> 00:32:14.484
He got lucky.

526
00:32:14.965 --> 00:32:15.284
Okay?

527
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.029
Bitcoin

528
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.669
does not forgive mistakes.

529
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.309
It's it's true and you need to

530
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.190
you need to face that and be aware of it because if you don't,

531
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.270
nobody at the bank is gonna bail you out if you lose your Bitcoin.

532
00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:33.154
Is that There

533
00:32:33.715 --> 00:32:37.554
is no central hotline to call up and say, I

534
00:32:38.515 --> 00:32:41.955
got socially engineered out of my Bitcoin, can you do something?

535
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.620
No.

536
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.300
Sorry.

537
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.340
Exactly. Okay.

538
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.379
No. It doesn't matter if you prove that you had it.

539
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.940
It's gone, it's gone. Yeah.

540
00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.420
And sing single signature

541
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.745
will always

542
00:32:58.904 --> 00:33:02.504
you can look at it this way. It's always assuming that you're never gonna fail.

543
00:33:03.384 --> 00:33:07.065
And given a long enough time span, most people do fail

544
00:33:07.225 --> 00:33:08.184
somehow.

545
00:33:09.065 --> 00:33:09.784
Alright?

546
00:33:10.184 --> 00:33:12.825
So the answer is and we've already, you know,

547
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.500
we've already let the cat out of the bag. But the answer is multisig.

548
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.140
Not

549
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.179
it's it's requiring more than one signature

550
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.059
in order to retrieve

551
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.420
that Bitcoin asset.

552
00:33:27.485 --> 00:33:31.645
So the way that they express this, they say multisig requires

553
00:33:31.645 --> 00:33:33.245
m of n keys

554
00:33:33.325 --> 00:33:37.405
in order to authorize a transaction. Can you give me an example of that,

555
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:38.605
Kenshin?

556
00:33:39.245 --> 00:33:41.005
Yeah. I have a few examples,

557
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.029
but I can give you the simplest one. So for example, you have

558
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.429
one of two keys.

559
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.429
So let's say that you and your wife each has a key,

560
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.710
and then you need one of of the keys to

561
00:33:56.095 --> 00:33:57.615
to move the Bitcoin.

562
00:33:57.855 --> 00:34:00.735
So if it's a shared How is that then oh,

563
00:34:01.535 --> 00:34:03.775
okay. So it's it's a shared

564
00:34:04.015 --> 00:34:04.735
account.

565
00:34:04.975 --> 00:34:19.120
Yeah. A shared spending account for example. Yeah. Yeah. That's really not much different than than a single signature. I think it gets more interesting once we get above that. So Yeah. That's that's the simplest one. But still, if you lose your key

566
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:29.895
Mhmm. Your wife still has one key. So that is And she can do better. Yeah. You're right. So it is it is safer in that aspect. Now if you lose your key, if it gets stolen,

567
00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:34.055
that other person can steal your money with that one key.

568
00:34:34.615 --> 00:34:35.175
So

569
00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:36.215
right?

570
00:34:36.455 --> 00:34:41.175
If I walk into your house, you and your wife have a a

571
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.820
two of two setup

572
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.220
and I grab your key phrase, seed phrase

573
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.900
and walk out the door

574
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.740
and go to the cafe,

575
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.275
you have until I get down, sit down and plug that in and plug in an address and move it

576
00:34:56.835 --> 00:34:58.995
to move your Bitcoin.

577
00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:00.995
Yeah. I mean, so

578
00:35:01.395 --> 00:35:06.515
then you set up you have, as you said, n of x keys or how do you call it?

579
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.600
So then you use m is is or m of n actually.

580
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.880
Like, so m comes before n in the alphabet. So what they're saying is like Yeah. Two of three or

581
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040
three I think it's three of five. Yeah.

582
00:35:21.144 --> 00:35:22.265
Go ahead. Yeah.

583
00:35:22.825 --> 00:35:28.105
But those are all examples because you can have, as you said I think also, you can have a two of two.

584
00:35:28.825 --> 00:35:35.944
So then you have for example, those are the simplest ones. So one of two is husband and wife, you have a sharing account.

585
00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:43.810
Then you can have two of two, and again, an example is husband and wife, you have a saving account and you need both of your signatures

586
00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:47.250
to access that. So Right. Again,

587
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.089
one of you, if if you fight or something and you go your separate ways,

588
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.275
none of you can take the Bitcoin.

589
00:35:54.434 --> 00:35:55.395
Need to Then agree on

590
00:35:56.755 --> 00:36:00.435
you have the usual, the most typical one, the two of three.

591
00:36:00.755 --> 00:36:06.835
Right. And and then we can equate that another nice example is the parent savings accounts for a child.

592
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.180
Okay. So you

593
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.980
have a key as a father, the mother has a key and the child has a key.

594
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.180
So then the two parents together they need to come together to move the money

595
00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:24.555
or the child needs to agree with one of the parents to move the money. Right.

596
00:36:27.035 --> 00:36:30.075
Not to be morbid but any person

597
00:36:30.394 --> 00:36:33.035
that trio could pass away

598
00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:35.530
and the money could still be moved.

599
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:36.490
Correct.

600
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:43.130
Let's say they kept the password in their head, which is not recommended but and it was not written down or whatever.

601
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.369
It that money would still be movable.

602
00:36:45.924 --> 00:36:54.964
Yeah. And if someone steals it or the key the child lose the key or whatever. Yeah. Exactly. They cannot so let's say

603
00:36:55.204 --> 00:36:57.845
let's say junior wrote the password down

604
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.800
because he's 12 years old and doesn't know any better and sticks it on his monitor

605
00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:08.760
and a thief breaks in and grabs it because he knows what a seed phrase is.

606
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.880
That thief cannot take that single

607
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.599
signature

608
00:37:13.935 --> 00:37:15.775
and move Bitcoin with it.

609
00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:16.895
Correct.

610
00:37:19.055 --> 00:37:22.575
You see the inbuilt security in this system.

611
00:37:22.655 --> 00:37:23.935
So you're trading

612
00:37:24.655 --> 00:37:25.775
simplicity

613
00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:27.055
for safety.

614
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:30.570
Does that make sense?

615
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.170
Clearly,

616
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.050
a single signature system is easier

617
00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:37.930
and cheaper for that matter typically,

618
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:38.410
but

619
00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:41.930
a multisig system is by design

620
00:37:43.484 --> 00:37:44.445
safer,

621
00:37:45.085 --> 00:37:49.645
less prone to I mean, you'd have to lose two out of three keys

622
00:37:50.525 --> 00:37:51.165
Correct.

623
00:37:51.565 --> 00:37:52.285
Somehow.

624
00:37:52.525 --> 00:37:58.620
And by the way, and this is something you need to think about. Let's say it was in that exact situation.

625
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.500
You've got two parents and one child,

626
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:07.180
but we throw all three signatures in the same safe or in the same drawer.

627
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.340
Yeah. That's You just

628
00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.380
defeated

629
00:38:11.744 --> 00:38:12.945
your security.

630
00:38:13.184 --> 00:38:13.744
Right?

631
00:38:14.464 --> 00:38:17.825
Because if something happens to those keys altogether

632
00:38:17.825 --> 00:38:19.265
then you're

633
00:38:19.744 --> 00:38:20.865
you're you're done.

634
00:38:21.825 --> 00:38:27.265
Yeah. As part of this you need to consider that and most likely

635
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.510
spread those keys out

636
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.510
even just a little bit geographically.

637
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:40.270
Yeah. Then you have there is a term for it, which I don't remember exactly, the

638
00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:41.595
geographically

639
00:38:41.595 --> 00:38:42.475
distributed

640
00:38:42.475 --> 00:38:43.755
multisigs,

641
00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:44.715
as you said.

642
00:38:45.515 --> 00:38:52.075
So, yes, you need to separate them. And many times people separate them even to different

643
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.860
countries.

644
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.540
The Yes. Jurisdiction

645
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.740
is even

646
00:38:57.619 --> 00:38:59.140
different, let's say.

647
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.100
If I had $10,000,000

648
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.260
worth of bitcoin or a $100,000,000,

649
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.065
I would not have it all in the same county in The United States. I would not have it all in the same state in The United States.

650
00:39:10.865 --> 00:39:13.185
I might not even have it in the same country.

651
00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:14.465
Yeah. Mean,

652
00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:16.385
just

653
00:39:16.385 --> 00:39:17.905
being that paranoid.

654
00:39:17.985 --> 00:39:23.260
We do have more examples that we're going to include a link to. It's in the Bitcoin Wiki.

655
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.460
Okay? So keys can live on different devices. They could be at different locations.

656
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.220
They could belong to different

657
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:30.940
people.

658
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.340
But in the end,

659
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.580
who's controlling all of this?

660
00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.619
Bitcoin.

661
00:39:37.155 --> 00:39:39.475
Bitcoin is the one that sets the rules.

662
00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:42.355
Not

663
00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:43.635
Coinbase.

664
00:39:43.635 --> 00:39:48.515
Not not even the parents. I mean, they're they're they're operating within the rules of Bitcoin.

665
00:39:48.835 --> 00:39:52.050
But in the end, it's Bitcoin, the protocol that's actually

666
00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:53.250
enforcing

667
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:53.810
that.

668
00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:57.570
Right? Mhmm. Yeah. Okay.

669
00:39:58.049 --> 00:39:59.010
Bitcoin,

670
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:03.410
multisig, been around for a long time. I'm not actually sure how long. Do you know?

671
00:40:05.025 --> 00:40:05.585
No.

672
00:40:06.224 --> 00:40:09.345
But I think quite a while because it was used,

673
00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:10.945
for escrows

674
00:40:10.945 --> 00:40:13.105
and exchanges and stuff. So

675
00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:15.665
I'm gonna find out.

676
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.800
Probably all the way back to BIP 11. Dang.

677
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.280
Was a long time ago. Early twenty twenty any early

678
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.200
twenty twelve.

679
00:40:28.494 --> 00:40:30.575
BIP 11, BIP 16,

680
00:40:30.655 --> 00:40:33.615
I've seen two different things but very early on.

681
00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:35.695
That's

682
00:40:35.695 --> 00:40:39.695
crazy it's been around that long. I did not know that.

683
00:40:40.015 --> 00:40:40.815
So right.

684
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.630
Exchanges certainly use these. This is how your coins are protected

685
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.750
on an exchange. It's how they should be.

686
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.030
So Yeah. You will hear

687
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.830
one thing we should introduce,

688
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.724
and we've discussed this in the past, but just for terminology

689
00:40:58.724 --> 00:40:59.605
sake.

690
00:41:00.964 --> 00:41:01.845
There is

691
00:41:02.645 --> 00:41:06.725
a terminology of a hot wallet and a cold wallet.

692
00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:08.005
Okay?

693
00:41:08.724 --> 00:41:10.805
Hot wallet is

694
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.300
something that's on my phone.

695
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.620
It's available anytime. It's gonna be a single signature setup.

696
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.540
There's no way that it can be more complicated than that.

697
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:22.740
Maybe it's Basically

698
00:41:23.915 --> 00:41:25.755
it's connected to the Internet.

699
00:41:25.994 --> 00:41:28.474
Yes. It's connected to Internet. Also.

700
00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:30.235
Yeah. But it's connected to the Internet.

701
00:41:31.515 --> 00:41:34.955
I'm gonna argue with you about that. I don't know. Maybe, but

702
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.210
in the sense that it had well,

703
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.130
I'm not okay. Sorry.

704
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.730
I don't know.

705
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:54.525
I don't know. Yes. It's connected to the Internet and that's one I I believe that being multisig kinda obviates that. It it

706
00:41:54.925 --> 00:41:56.285
means it's not true.

707
00:41:57.485 --> 00:41:59.165
I'm not sure. I

708
00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:06.490
mean, you can have I think the blue wallets has a multisig function. It's still considered a hot wallet. It's connected to the Internet.

709
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:12.410
Someone could hack your phone and and steal all the three keys from it. Why not?

710
00:42:12.809 --> 00:42:14.730
But with a

711
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:25.335
it's Coinbase, for example. The vast majority of their money and they have a lot is stored offline. It's not connected to the Internet. It's in cold storage.

712
00:42:25.735 --> 00:42:28.375
And it's also I'm sure multisig.

713
00:42:28.935 --> 00:42:29.735
Yeah.

714
00:42:30.295 --> 00:42:34.200
You can also have cold storage with one one signature.

715
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.400
You could.

716
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.160
Would hope that they were smart enough not to do that.

717
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.520
I don't have any assets on Coinbase so

718
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.280
it doesn't matter.

719
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.200
So

720
00:42:47.255 --> 00:42:52.535
multisig has been around for a long time. It's not some bolt on that was just added recently.

721
00:42:52.615 --> 00:42:54.695
And you you can trust

722
00:42:55.335 --> 00:42:57.095
the things that are built with it.

723
00:42:57.895 --> 00:43:05.230
Does that make sense? Mhmm. Like if if I've got a multisig setup, that's going to be more secure than a single sig setup.

724
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:06.670
Mhmm.

725
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.030
Alright. So

726
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.550
just to

727
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:19.425
maybe reiterate some of this, but what is multisig protecting you from? Single device theft. Not a problem. Hey,

728
00:43:20.545 --> 00:43:27.105
dude. I want your wallet and your hardware wallet because I'm a smart criminal and I know that's a Bitcoin wallet.

729
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.930
Here. Okay.

730
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.850
Too bad you'll find out later you can't do anything with that.

731
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.770
Yep. Sucker.

732
00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:36.690
Okay.

733
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.690
Single seed exposure,

734
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:44.045
same thing really. Right? Oh. Oh. Oh. I I can I can give a nice

735
00:43:44.925 --> 00:43:45.965
tip there? Yeah.

736
00:43:46.685 --> 00:43:48.605
Yeah. You have a single you

737
00:43:49.405 --> 00:43:54.730
have one of the devices. Right? Mhmm. That the the thief takes from you.

738
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.810
You can use that one key as its own wallet as well.

739
00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:00.970
So you could place

740
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.610
some

741
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:14.445
Bitcoin in there and say here keep them from, like, coming back at you again later? Yeah. Yeah. It's like, here it is. You took it. You you put it on a you use the key, and you see there is some Bitcoin.

742
00:44:14.605 --> 00:44:23.480
That's all I thousand sats in there or something. Yeah. Yeah. Or a little bit more to make it more realistic but yeah. You got me. There Sats it

743
00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:27.800
are gonna be worth a dollar one day. I am not giving them that much.

744
00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:28.680
Maybe

745
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.160
not a dollar.

746
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.945
I do hope for 1¢. 1¢ sat is

747
00:44:36.945 --> 00:44:38.625
is it 10,000,000? No.

748
00:44:44.785 --> 00:44:46.625
Because there's a 100 sats to a dollar.

749
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.349
100

750
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:50.470
to dollar.

751
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:53.830
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 10,000,000.

752
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:58.310
Okay. I'll cut that out too because that's just ridiculous.

753
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:59.430
Okay.

754
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:05.185
It it same thing. It's going to it's

755
00:45:05.185 --> 00:45:08.225
going to protect you from, you know, your seed,

756
00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:11.345
a single seed being exposed.

757
00:45:11.345 --> 00:45:15.585
Oh, I left it out on my counter and the maid came through and cleaned up.

758
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:19.390
Okay. They still can't do anything.

759
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.990
Malware.

760
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.030
One

761
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.990
of these days, I'm gonna make this prediction, one of these days,

762
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.230
one of these hardware signers,

763
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.869
cold card,

764
00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:31.795
most likely,

765
00:45:32.435 --> 00:45:34.355
one of the Ledger,

766
00:45:35.395 --> 00:45:39.955
Trezor most likely one of those two. They're going to be compromised with malware.

767
00:45:40.675 --> 00:45:42.515
Okay? It will happen.

768
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.550
A

769
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.430
multisig

770
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.110
setup protects

771
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.910
that

772
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.950
problem.

773
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.990
You do not have to trust

774
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.950
ledger,

775
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.910
treasurer,

776
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.790
seed signer,

777
00:45:56.175 --> 00:46:00.575
jade, whomever. I'm sure I'm not remembering

778
00:46:00.735 --> 00:46:01.935
20 of them.

779
00:46:02.735 --> 00:46:10.015
Right. But okay. But now we're assuming that let's say you have a three out of five multi six so you

780
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.390
and those three devices

781
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.430
or well,

782
00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:18.270
three out of five is a lot. Let's say two out of three.

783
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.390
Right. So you have three unique devices.

784
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:26.795
So you have one treasury, you have one ledger, you have one cold card, and one of them gets compromised

785
00:46:26.795 --> 00:46:28.075
by malware.

786
00:46:29.515 --> 00:46:31.915
Otherwise, if you have three of the same

787
00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:33.275
manufacturers,

788
00:46:33.275 --> 00:46:35.035
then all three get compromised.

789
00:46:35.434 --> 00:46:36.075
Now

790
00:46:36.234 --> 00:46:37.515
here's a thought.

791
00:46:37.994 --> 00:46:40.234
I don't wanna test this, but if,

792
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.480
for example, I had

793
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.080
let's say I had three cold cards. I'll pick on them

794
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.760
and cold card I'm gets

795
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:56.495
not a big fan. I'm just I'm being honest. I know that they're not a sponsor of this show and they never will be so it doesn't matter.

796
00:47:00.335 --> 00:47:02.815
Let's say they get malware,

797
00:47:03.615 --> 00:47:07.455
can I tape my seed phrases and move them somewhere else

798
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.000
without ever even opening up those three devices?

799
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.000
Yes.

800
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.360
Okay.

801
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:15.800
Good.

802
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.320
I thought so.

803
00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.520
Right?

804
00:47:22.464 --> 00:47:35.265
I think so. Yeah. Something to think about. Yeah. I haven't I think so. It did yeah. Yeah. It is possible. I know with the seed cider you could because it follows a BIP standard. I mean, I can't guarantee that for treasurer or whomever.

805
00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:41.240
But if it follows the BIP standards for seed phrases, whether that's 12 or 24,

806
00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:46.599
and the password, which I don't know where that comes from, but it's defined in a BIP standard.

807
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:55.095
As long as it follows those, I can just take what I've got which is really just a series of words and plug them into that.

808
00:47:56.055 --> 00:47:57.815
Yeah. It's that simple. It

809
00:47:58.215 --> 00:48:02.615
is. When I do this I will probably do three seed signers.

810
00:48:02.855 --> 00:48:09.900
Screw it. That's what I'm doing. And oh, one other thing while I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I apologize. I'll cut that out.

811
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:19.019
I shouldn't say that. But one other thing while I'm thinking about it. Can you not mix in software as well? Can I run

812
00:48:21.475 --> 00:48:22.755
the blue wallet?

813
00:48:22.835 --> 00:48:26.035
Does blue wallet run on a desktop? I believe it does.

814
00:48:26.515 --> 00:48:27.155
Right?

815
00:48:27.875 --> 00:48:29.955
I don't know. No?

816
00:48:30.435 --> 00:48:43.040
I don't know. Okay. Let's just say I'm gonna run one as a desktop wallet. It doesn't matter who makes Sure. Sparrow. I don't know this off top of my head. Sparrow. I can do that and mix that with two hardware devices. Right?

817
00:48:43.359 --> 00:48:45.520
Yeah. I mean, again, it's it's

818
00:48:46.445 --> 00:48:52.845
it's all boils down to the Bitcoin protocol that drives all this. Right? It's just a series of words

819
00:48:53.565 --> 00:48:54.685
and passwords.

820
00:48:55.325 --> 00:48:56.045
Alright.

821
00:48:56.605 --> 00:48:57.725
Where are we at?

822
00:48:58.845 --> 00:49:01.660
Yeah. One bad decision under stress.

823
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.820
It takes you longer to do a multisync

824
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:13.980
setup, I guess, and you have to bring in more people. So one bad person's one person's bad decision.

825
00:49:15.075 --> 00:49:16.995
And and some coercion

826
00:49:17.155 --> 00:49:18.035
scenarios.

827
00:49:18.195 --> 00:49:24.115
If somebody comes and threatens me and I have my my wallets geographically

828
00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:25.235
distributed,

829
00:49:25.795 --> 00:49:28.195
even if I control all three of them,

830
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.640
A person who's trying to get money from me is not going to

831
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.360
what are they gonna do? Ride in the car with me as I go from site to site?

832
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.560
There's

833
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.880
too much chance of

834
00:49:43.194 --> 00:49:44.234
a problem

835
00:49:44.714 --> 00:49:46.155
on their end.

836
00:49:46.155 --> 00:49:47.755
Does that make It's

837
00:49:47.755 --> 00:49:48.715
too hard.

838
00:49:49.275 --> 00:49:51.275
You're making it more difficult for them.

839
00:49:51.595 --> 00:50:02.660
Yeah. And I have also thought like you can give it to a family member in another as you said state or country or whatever. So one key they can have and you

840
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:09.940
since it's a multi sig, they cannot do anything with it. And then you can tell them if I ever call you

841
00:50:11.085 --> 00:50:13.405
on a day that is not a Thursday

842
00:50:13.725 --> 00:50:15.405
at 9PM,

843
00:50:15.405 --> 00:50:16.445
then you know

844
00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:23.405
I'm in trouble, let's say. What if it's somebody I never call? If I ever call you, you know I'm in trouble.

845
00:50:23.885 --> 00:50:24.285
Exact

846
00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.260
Yeah. But about the Bitcoin related

847
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:34.140
thing. So it's like, I will only call you for the Bitcoin key on a Thursday night. Any other day,

848
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.060
you call the police. Consider me compromised and act accordingly.

849
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.735
Like, call the police and stall

850
00:50:40.735 --> 00:50:41.695
and whatever.

851
00:50:41.935 --> 00:50:44.175
Alright. I love this line, multisync

852
00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:48.735
adds friction where you want friction. Yes. It is definitely more difficult

853
00:50:49.215 --> 00:50:51.295
but it is worth it because

854
00:50:51.855 --> 00:50:53.135
when it works,

855
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.740
it's a beautiful thing.

856
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.340
Alright.

857
00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:07.020
What are some of the realities of this? You can still lose too many keys. In a two out of three setup, just to make this simple, yes, you can lose two keys and not be able to move that money.

858
00:51:08.705 --> 00:51:15.185
Okay? Bad backups. I mean, if you have the keys, you can you don't need backups, but

859
00:51:16.225 --> 00:51:18.385
you don't lose your backups.

860
00:51:19.345 --> 00:51:20.145
Ove engineering.

861
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:25.100
Maybe making it too complicated. You do not need a seven of nine

862
00:51:25.339 --> 00:51:27.020
backup strategy

863
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.780
unless

864
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.660
you're a

865
00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.020
multinational

866
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:31.980
corporation

867
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.020
maybe. I don't know. Not testing recovery.

868
00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:38.185
Go ahead. There there was a popular Bitcoiner

869
00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:39.625
on Twitter

870
00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:43.465
some years ago that's What does this mean? I

871
00:51:43.465 --> 00:51:46.825
don't remember. That messed up their multisig

872
00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:49.465
setup. Made it too complex and

873
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.280
someone did it. Anyway yeah. But it happens to you and me. Yeah? Yeah.

874
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.680
It does happen. Look.

875
00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:02.000
I doubt anybody whoever listens to this is gonna need more than two or three.

876
00:52:02.799 --> 00:52:06.555
Right. That's just a reality. Reality. If you do, that's you,

877
00:52:06.955 --> 00:52:21.440
that's terrific, but you are building a more complex system and you need to be careful about that. You also need to and we're not really gonna talk about inheritance here, but it is something to think about. Poor inheritance planning. What happens when you die

878
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.720
and when you add more keys to the mix and they're spread them out among other people, well then you you have to manage that as well.

879
00:52:30.275 --> 00:52:32.275
Okay? Mhmm. Yep.

880
00:52:33.155 --> 00:52:34.995
It doesn't replace discipline.

881
00:52:34.995 --> 00:52:36.755
It doesn't replace education.

882
00:52:36.835 --> 00:52:40.435
It doesn't fix laziness. You need to know what you're doing.

883
00:52:41.635 --> 00:52:45.680
Yeah. If you're new to this, probably go back and listen to this again.

884
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.440
I would certainly take the time to do this with a very small amount of Bitcoin.

885
00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.800
Not only adding it to your service but, and I brought this up earlier,

886
00:52:57.265 --> 00:53:00.145
one of us did, doing a restore.

887
00:53:00.865 --> 00:53:04.065
Do a restore of your coin.

888
00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:07.585
Make sure you can get access to it,

889
00:53:08.305 --> 00:53:09.744
not just put it there.

890
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.500
Right.

891
00:53:15.619 --> 00:53:16.420
Alright.

892
00:53:19.619 --> 00:53:23.620
Yeah. Just to kinda go along with that, I don't wanna spend a whole lot of time on that.

893
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.099
Your setup

894
00:53:26.685 --> 00:53:27.885
needs to match

895
00:53:28.285 --> 00:53:30.045
your risk profile.

896
00:53:30.205 --> 00:53:30.845
Again,

897
00:53:31.885 --> 00:53:38.365
99% of the people that listen to this are they're just never gonna have to deal with anything more than maybe a two or three.

898
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:46.640
You know? I I very likely see ten years from now, like I said, even if you only have say a tenth of a Bitcoin,

899
00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:56.235
the value of that Bitcoin ten years from now will be much much higher and you need to plan for that. And you need to plan for that now

900
00:53:56.315 --> 00:53:58.315
because when you lose it,

901
00:53:58.795 --> 00:53:59.355
that

902
00:54:00.795 --> 00:54:02.635
potential growth is lost.

903
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:05.780
Because

904
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.380
the reality is

905
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:11.140
three years from now if you lose a tenth of a Bitcoin,

906
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.540
you're not gonna go out and buy another tenth of a Bitcoin immediately.

907
00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.780
That's just not gonna happen.

908
00:54:19.855 --> 00:54:20.494
And

909
00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:23.055
it it'll just be gone

910
00:54:23.214 --> 00:54:24.815
and you'll never gain

911
00:54:24.974 --> 00:54:25.615
that.

912
00:54:26.174 --> 00:54:32.575
I don't know. What happens if ten years from now it's a million dollar bitcoin? That means it's a $100,000.

913
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:36.790
Crazy.

914
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:38.790
Yeah.

915
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:41.590
Alright.

916
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.350
Yeah.

917
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.550
Right.

918
00:54:45.795 --> 00:54:47.395
So in general,

919
00:54:48.115 --> 00:54:49.075
who is

920
00:54:49.155 --> 00:54:50.275
multisig,

921
00:54:50.595 --> 00:54:51.635
good for?

922
00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:54.275
And you mentioned it,

923
00:54:54.675 --> 00:54:59.714
a lot. You said, yeah, for people who care about the future. Right? So

924
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:02.390
it's for us who look long term,

925
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:06.869
and it's also for people thinking about planning

926
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:08.710
for their inheritance.

927
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:14.789
And in general, if if you're serious about Bitcoin, I would say, it's

928
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:19.635
as you said, a tenth of a Bitcoin and even less will be significant

929
00:55:20.994 --> 00:55:21.875
one day.

930
00:55:22.595 --> 00:55:24.435
It's also good for businesses.

931
00:55:25.075 --> 00:55:25.875
I mean,

932
00:55:27.315 --> 00:55:32.590
having a business and having a three out of five in that case, that's very popular for a business.

933
00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:37.470
And even bigger businesses might have more complex setups.

934
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:41.470
And there are some smart ways to to manage the

935
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:46.670
the signatures. I mean, you can give a signature to a newly appointed

936
00:55:47.525 --> 00:55:48.405
employee.

937
00:55:48.885 --> 00:55:56.405
Mhmm. And then you cancel that signature when they leave the company, then you make another one. You know, it can be dynamic too. So for companies, it's very good.

938
00:55:56.805 --> 00:55:59.845
So you can swap out keys in a multisig setup?

939
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.590
Yeah.

940
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:02.869
It's more complex.

941
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.109
Yeah. But it's quite complex.

942
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:06.150
Mhmm.

943
00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:09.990
So you I think you need a special software to do all this.

944
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:11.030
Okay.

945
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:15.030
Well, it's definitely something if you're thinking about doing, you need to test.

946
00:56:15.725 --> 00:56:16.845
Okay. Yeah.

947
00:56:18.605 --> 00:56:19.565
Exactly.

948
00:56:19.565 --> 00:56:20.045
So

949
00:56:21.485 --> 00:56:22.765
it's good for

950
00:56:23.165 --> 00:56:25.405
all of those people and

951
00:56:27.005 --> 00:56:33.700
yeah. And it's probably not needed if you if you just want to experiment with Bitcoin with small amounts

952
00:56:33.859 --> 00:56:34.660
and

953
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.020
and you just want to do a purchase here and there or

954
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.420
or if it's you can use a Lightning Wallet, for example, to do,

955
00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:45.045
like, Noster

956
00:56:45.685 --> 00:56:49.525
transactions or or on Fountain to boost us or something.

957
00:56:50.085 --> 00:56:51.045
Yes, please.

958
00:56:51.365 --> 00:56:54.485
Yeah. It it's for for exactly.

959
00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:57.860
For spending SATs, I would say, for easily

960
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.820
everyday spending SATs, Multisig is overkill.

961
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:05.620
So you can split it up that your Multisig is like your your

962
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.700
long term savings account

963
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:14.775
and then you have a normal hot wallet that you just keep a small amount there for your everyday spending needs.

964
00:57:18.855 --> 00:57:19.495
Yeah.

965
00:57:19.975 --> 00:57:20.855
But, otherwise,

966
00:57:22.775 --> 00:57:23.815
that's,

967
00:57:24.535 --> 00:57:26.135
yeah, that's it. That's the basics.

968
00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:28.720
Yeah. And then you can

969
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.680
usual

970
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.160
usually, yeah, mix

971
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.040
setups.

972
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.040
Right. As I said, you can have a

973
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.720
savings

974
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.400
account as a Modisig.

975
00:57:40.494 --> 00:57:45.215
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what I said already. It's the same thing there. Sorry.

976
00:57:46.335 --> 00:57:52.975
Like to view this almost as a checking account versus a savings account. And a multisig

977
00:57:52.975 --> 00:57:56.200
is my vault that I've got to go to

978
00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:00.279
specifically

979
00:58:00.279 --> 00:58:01.160
and do

980
00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:09.525
specific actions in order to access. It's like you go to the vault and three people put their keys in and turn at the same time, spin

981
00:58:09.525 --> 00:58:13.205
the knob or whatever, and now you've got access to the vault.

982
00:58:13.445 --> 00:58:17.525
I'm not gonna carry that around on my phone. That doesn't make sense.

983
00:58:19.285 --> 00:58:22.165
Maybe a signing key on the phone, I guess,

984
00:58:22.839 --> 00:58:31.320
But my hot what? I would be concerned about that because it is a pain to replace a key or to build out a new set or whatever.

985
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.440
Why

986
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.960
even

987
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.880
do that? I'm gonna have a checking account

988
00:58:38.454 --> 00:58:39.415
where I

989
00:58:39.895 --> 00:58:43.735
I can just spend out of. That's my lightning wallet essentially.

990
00:58:43.974 --> 00:58:45.735
Is that a fair analogy?

991
00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:47.015
I mean Yeah.

992
00:58:47.734 --> 00:58:55.560
Other people may do different things. I don't know. That's just kind of the way I think about it. Bitcoin is for spending by the way. Don't listen to the haters.

993
00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.040
It's also for savings

994
00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.800
but and it should be both. Yeah.

995
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.400
But you

996
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:03.640
know,

997
00:59:04.235 --> 00:59:05.515
yeah. Anyways.

998
00:59:06.715 --> 00:59:08.315
Moving right along.

999
00:59:08.555 --> 00:59:11.275
And some of the best practices

1000
00:59:11.275 --> 00:59:11.915
for

1001
00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:18.089
storing those keys as we mentioned it now a few times, Separate the keys geographically

1002
00:59:18.089 --> 00:59:19.290
if possible,

1003
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:22.330
but don't make it too hard either.

1004
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:27.770
I mean, you need to put the key somewhere you can trust and that you find it again or

1005
00:59:28.345 --> 00:59:34.185
one else finds it. I need a reason to go to Sweden. Will you be my Right. Three of five

1006
00:59:34.505 --> 00:59:35.305
whatever?

1007
00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:36.825
I don't know. Yeah. Exactly.

1008
00:59:38.265 --> 00:59:38.905
Anyways

1009
00:59:39.145 --> 00:59:40.265
And then we

1010
00:59:40.265 --> 00:59:43.625
also talked about avoiding a single vendor

1011
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.620
wallet manufacturer. And

1012
00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:58.855
then also don't store the key with the device. So if you have a hardware we mean keys, by the way. Yeah. I mean, is your backup.

1013
00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:03.095
It's not like it's a a balance of the account or something.

1014
01:00:03.255 --> 01:00:06.375
It is literally the 12 or 24 words

1015
01:00:07.175 --> 01:00:09.575
and associated password if you do that.

1016
01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:12.855
Yeah. So ideally, you have a sign a sign in device.

1017
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:16.830
One of those devices you store somewhere safe,

1018
01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:20.030
and then you have the the seed phrase for that device

1019
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.950
stored in another location

1020
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:24.430
as a backup.

1021
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.270
So if if that device gets compromised or

1022
01:00:28.845 --> 01:00:34.205
or not even compromised, then you don't want to use the key. But if it gets broken or something,

1023
01:00:34.845 --> 01:00:37.165
then you can restore that that device.

1024
01:00:38.685 --> 01:00:41.805
You said it many times, you need to test the recovery

1025
01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.244
before

1026
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.490
committing to that setup,

1027
01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.770
and you need to document

1028
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.010
the setup in in a way that,

1029
01:00:51.809 --> 01:00:55.330
yeah, if something happens to you, your family can

1030
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.809
can take the Bitcoin and and use it.

1031
01:00:58.615 --> 01:01:01.975
And be careful about that documentation,

1032
01:01:02.055 --> 01:01:03.175
ladies and gentlemen.

1033
01:01:03.415 --> 01:01:07.575
Do not put your seed words in that documentation.

1034
01:01:07.815 --> 01:01:08.535
Right.

1035
01:01:09.175 --> 01:01:15.410
Because most likely, you're writing it online for one thing or on a computer that's connected online.

1036
01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:20.370
So there's potentials there that we just wanna eliminate anyways,

1037
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:29.295
but it's not it's just not a smart thing to have that seed phrase right there. Oh, plug in this 12 word seed phrase.

1038
01:01:31.935 --> 01:01:32.655
That

1039
01:01:33.535 --> 01:01:34.735
would be separate.

1040
01:01:35.535 --> 01:01:37.215
Just my 2¢.

1041
01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:38.255
I'm just

1042
01:01:38.255 --> 01:01:39.615
gonna throw that out there.

1043
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:46.610
Yeah. And before we close this up, I would say there is an alternative

1044
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.450
to multisig

1045
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.370
that is very, very similar.

1046
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:54.930
And some some Shamir secret sharing,

1047
01:01:55.434 --> 01:01:56.234
essentially,

1048
01:01:56.234 --> 01:02:00.555
you cut a single key into pieces, as many pieces as you want,

1049
01:02:01.275 --> 01:02:05.915
and you need a certain amount of pieces. Again, you can cut it in five pieces,

1050
01:02:06.395 --> 01:02:07.355
and you tell

1051
01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:10.510
the system that you need three out of the five pieces

1052
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:12.110
to

1053
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.310
restore

1054
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:14.910
the signature.

1055
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:21.710
So essentially it's the same and I know systems that you can actually engrave those pieces into steel

1056
01:02:22.065 --> 01:02:23.585
with a QR code.

1057
01:02:25.425 --> 01:02:27.744
Is this what is it called? The

1058
01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.825
not the seed signer.

1059
01:02:30.865 --> 01:02:33.984
Anyway, there is a really nice device engraver.

1060
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:40.490
Right. That it engraves in metal like you're I wonder if they can sponsor the show. Sorry.

1061
01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:41.210
Yeah.

1062
01:02:42.329 --> 01:02:44.170
That sounds very cool.

1063
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:58.035
Yeah. Then it's easy to scan those pieces and restore the key and you use it like a normal signature. So that's also cool. But that we can go into more in-depth how to do this. And I know a friend of mine has done it, and

1064
01:02:58.435 --> 01:03:00.995
they even store a backup into a DVD.

1065
01:03:00.995 --> 01:03:02.755
So they burn also the

1066
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:11.000
that that key that piece of the key in the DVD. So it's it's some cool setups that we can discuss in a more advanced episode.

1067
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.120
So that's Okay. Well,

1068
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.720
let's wrap this up.

1069
01:03:16.595 --> 01:03:17.714
We need to

1070
01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:23.234
we need to realize a couple things. Bitcoin is going to give you absolute responsibility.

1071
01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:27.635
If you accept it and you take your money off of Coinbase

1072
01:03:27.635 --> 01:03:28.755
or Kraken

1073
01:03:28.835 --> 01:03:29.474
or

1074
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.150
someplace like that.

1075
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.470
It is now your responsibility

1076
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:37.550
and that weighs heavy on some people. It should not, but it does.

1077
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.270
Multisig

1078
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:40.910
is

1079
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:44.695
the only way I'm aware of with

1080
01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:45.735
Bitcoin

1081
01:03:45.895 --> 01:03:49.015
to do well, other than what you just described,

1082
01:03:49.095 --> 01:03:51.415
which is technically not multisig.

1083
01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:53.095
I'll say that.

1084
01:03:53.415 --> 01:03:56.135
But multisig distributes that responsibility

1085
01:03:56.135 --> 01:03:56.615
safely.

1086
01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.180
We're not talking the goal isn't perfect security. That's almost impossible.

1087
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.260
But the goal is resilience.

1088
01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:15.035
It's taking the most common use cases of people losing their keys and eliminating that as a point of failure. You know, this

1089
01:04:15.355 --> 01:04:17.115
multisix setup eliminates

1090
01:04:17.115 --> 01:04:21.275
so many issues when you actually sit down and think about it.

1091
01:04:22.795 --> 01:04:23.515
Okay.

1092
01:04:23.835 --> 01:04:32.460
Hey. I I wanna change something on the fly here. I'm actually gonna do two questions of the week. Is that okay? I'm gonna do the one we've got, but I have a new one.

1093
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:37.100
I hesitate to do this, but I feel like we probably need to ask.

1094
01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:47.155
Are you running multisig for your Bitcoin? So first of all, that's the one about our topic today like we normally do. If so, watch your setup

1095
01:04:47.315 --> 01:04:49.155
as much as you're willing to share.

1096
01:04:49.475 --> 01:04:52.710
If you wanna send your seed phrases to me, don't do that.

1097
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.030
If not, why not?

1098
01:04:55.750 --> 01:05:06.070
Okay? So that's the that's our normal question. I wanna ask a second one. I know we talk about AI a lot on here. It is a large part of Kenshin and I's personal

1099
01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:11.205
lives at this point. I don't actually see that changing anytime soon.

1100
01:05:11.365 --> 01:05:15.605
And I I joke about it, but I'm not trying to turn this into an AI podcast.

1101
01:05:16.965 --> 01:05:19.285
I wanna make I wanna be respectful.

1102
01:05:19.365 --> 01:05:21.300
We can shorten these conversations

1103
01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:28.900
up about our AI stuff if you guys would like. If you're just like, no, Bitcoin only. I don't know. Whatever.

1104
01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.740
Please let us know. Is that a fair question, Kenshin?

1105
01:05:33.185 --> 01:05:38.785
I don't really wanna hear the answer because I'm afraid by and large people don't want to know.

1106
01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:41.265
But

1107
01:05:41.984 --> 01:05:44.305
I also wanna be respectful.

1108
01:05:44.305 --> 01:05:46.305
Is that fair? I I think that is.

1109
01:05:47.289 --> 01:05:48.890
So let's find out.

1110
01:05:49.289 --> 01:05:53.369
If you really don't want it, then we'll shorten that up because I know that segment

1111
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:58.490
these days at least and we are aware of this. It's kinda gotten a little long and I I do wanna

1112
01:05:59.214 --> 01:06:08.495
we are gonna try and tighten it up a little bit. But man, there's just so much going on. Anyways, again, not an AI podcast. We're not gonna start off into that.

1113
01:06:09.135 --> 01:06:11.775
Alright. Let's talk about some news.

1114
01:06:12.175 --> 01:06:14.494
Maybe the number one topic for the week.

1115
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.190
It is number one on our list.

1116
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:22.070
Maybe number one in our heart our hearts. We're also not a silver podcast,

1117
01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:23.510
by the way. I

1118
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:26.790
wanna talk about this though because

1119
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:27.590
I believe

1120
01:06:28.345 --> 01:06:29.705
this is indicative

1121
01:06:29.705 --> 01:06:31.785
of the overall macro

1122
01:06:31.865 --> 01:06:33.465
market and I do.

1123
01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:40.665
This is important to me. Okay? Because it does ultimately affect Bitcoin. We know that Bitcoin's down.

1124
01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:43.145
I believe this is one of the reasons.

1125
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.100
So let's dive into this. Fox News had an article,

1126
01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.180
Friday basically

1127
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.700
silver took a huge dump and like 30%.

1128
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:54.740
It was insane.

1129
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.100
It bounced back. It's dropped again,

1130
01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:03.735
bounced back and today's been kind of up but it's I mean it's just all over the place.

1131
01:07:05.095 --> 01:07:13.495
Like a meme coin. Like a meme coin, exactly. Was just fixing to say that. That's what people are saying, it's like a meme coin, I'm like this is silver.

1132
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.180
Anyways,

1133
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.380
apparently,

1134
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:22.060
according to this article, and this somewhat makes sense, and I'm just gonna read the kind of the opening paragraph

1135
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.020
because this summarizes the whole thing nicely.

1136
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.995
A single announcement out of Washington sent gold and silver prices plunging, erasing billions

1137
01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:37.075
erasing billions of dollars in market value, catching investors off guard almost overnight.

1138
01:07:37.715 --> 01:07:38.835
Friday morning,

1139
01:07:40.915 --> 01:07:42.995
president Trump confirmed

1140
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:49.750
Kevin Wash, I hope I'm saying his name right, w a r s h, as his pick to lead the Federal Reserve,

1141
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:52.070
which should happen I believe in May

1142
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:53.829
when Jerome Powell steps down.

1143
01:07:54.785 --> 01:07:55.505
Okay?

1144
01:07:56.145 --> 01:08:01.265
Sending the dollar to its strongest level in months and reshaping expectations

1145
01:08:01.345 --> 01:08:03.505
for US monetary policy.

1146
01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:12.250
Wash is widely viewed as a free market inflation hawk who breaks with much of the current Federal Reserve leadership.

1147
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:19.210
This to me is the important part. Influenced by his studies under economist Milton Friedman,

1148
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:26.725
who from what I can tell is somebody that I align with a lot. Now, I haven't read everything that Friedman said.

1149
01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:29.765
I'm sure there's lots of stuff we would disagree on.

1150
01:08:30.085 --> 01:08:31.925
But in modern economic

1151
01:08:31.925 --> 01:08:42.110
history, he's one of the few people I actually align with, if that makes sense. He's long argued that inflation is driven by printing too much money.

1152
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:43.230
Okay?

1153
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:48.110
And so that sent the market into a dizzy a tizzy,

1154
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:50.270
you know,

1155
01:08:50.974 --> 01:08:55.614
silver was already very much overhyped at that point. I was already saying

1156
01:08:55.855 --> 01:09:00.734
it's probably gonna have a drawback. Now, I didn't see it going from one twenty to

1157
01:09:00.895 --> 01:09:02.334
70 or something

1158
01:09:03.454 --> 01:09:04.414
crazy

1159
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.520
like that. But it it literally was 30% in one day at one point.

1160
01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.320
But it comes from this, but I don't

1161
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:22.385
do I believe that Kevin Walsh is his top pick? Yes. Do I believe that he most likely will become the next Fed chair?

1162
01:09:22.545 --> 01:09:23.505
Most likely.

1163
01:09:24.145 --> 01:09:25.584
Do I believe that

1164
01:09:25.905 --> 01:09:35.699
that Kevin Wash after Trump has said for months and months and months and months, inflation down, inflation down, not inflation, interest rates

1165
01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.659
because of our federal deficit,

1166
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.539
because of the debt that is coming due,

1167
01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:48.414
and because of the fact that midterms are coming up, I believe that he's gonna pressure Kevin Walsh,

1168
01:09:49.215 --> 01:09:55.934
cut interest rates, cut look, you're my man. I put you in here. You do what I say because that's what Trump does.

1169
01:09:56.735 --> 01:10:00.014
Okay? I think we can all admit that even if you're a Trump

1170
01:10:00.255 --> 01:10:00.894
fanboy.

1171
01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:02.729
Okay?

1172
01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:11.849
And then I also think the money printing still gonna happen. So in the long run, we're gonna see the same thing play out. I just don't think this changes anything

1173
01:10:11.849 --> 01:10:14.570
in the long run. I think it changed things

1174
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:16.010
Friday

1175
01:10:15.575 --> 01:10:23.655
until whatever time that they get all this sorted out and everybody figures out. You know what? That guy is not really gonna do anything.

1176
01:10:24.295 --> 01:10:25.815
That's just my thoughts.

1177
01:10:26.535 --> 01:10:28.055
That that that guy,

1178
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:33.290
I only heard one clip of him and he sounds like a Wall Street dude.

1179
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:40.010
Yeah. He was he was throwing all these Wall Street keywords,

1180
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:44.090
and I don't even remember those type of words because they're they're really like,

1181
01:10:44.945 --> 01:10:57.585
oh, you just put a sprinkle of this and and then you invest a little bit of this and a little bit of that. And then Yeah. The the interviewer was asking how much Bitcoin allocation should you have. No. Not 5%. 5% is too much, he was saying.

1182
01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:01.950
It it was really, like, one of those really

1183
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:09.550
dudes, you know Right. In quotations that talk about how to make the most money with investing in most Interesting. Things.

1184
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:14.614
So for me, it's really not good news. It sounds another meme coin

1185
01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:15.974
So person.

1186
01:11:17.255 --> 01:11:18.695
Have been seen again.

1187
01:11:19.014 --> 01:11:19.815
In

1188
01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:21.334
Austrian economics

1189
01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:23.255
up to my eyeballs for

1190
01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.820
a long time,

1191
01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:31.940
for years now at this point. And I've not really studied the modern economists,

1192
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:40.715
so I don't wanna go too far out on a limb. But I will say that Milton Friedman is the only person who I've heard any kind of quotes from recently

1193
01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:41.755
past

1194
01:11:41.835 --> 01:11:44.395
Hayek who was an Austrian economist

1195
01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:47.594
that I've even somewhat agreed with.

1196
01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:51.595
So I think it's very interesting that he studied under him.

1197
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:58.909
I don't know about all that. I will have to look into it. But that doesn't mean anything. I mean, you could have studied

1198
01:11:59.869 --> 01:12:02.429
so it's not Milton Friedman. It's

1199
01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:11.795
I don't I don't think it matters under who he studied. It matters who he is. And the way he was talking it's it's really become a casino.

1200
01:12:11.955 --> 01:12:17.155
I also think it matters if he will stand up to Trump because this is 100%

1201
01:12:17.315 --> 01:12:18.115
opposed

1202
01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:20.114
to what Trump has been saying

1203
01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:21.715
for two years.

1204
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:25.830
Well, however well, more than that really, but yeah.

1205
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.870
Right?

1206
01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:28.630
Honestly,

1207
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:33.350
I'm tired of of American politics. I I know. It's it's

1208
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.950
just too much nonsense.

1209
01:12:35.665 --> 01:12:42.784
And Trump I'm sorry. But Trump, I just heard this quote last week saying, I can do the

1210
01:12:43.264 --> 01:12:46.304
the dollar go up or down like a yo yo. Exactly.

1211
01:12:46.864 --> 01:12:52.080
That's exactly what I'm talking about. Trump feels like he can control the dollar.

1212
01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:04.880
So are you telling me he's gonna put somebody in there that he doesn't have his thumb on that he can't control after all the goings on with Powell? You're exactly that's exactly what I'm talking about.

1213
01:13:05.865 --> 01:13:08.025
I'm just extending that on out.

1214
01:13:08.265 --> 01:13:25.110
It doesn't matter what Warsh says when he talks. It matters what he does. Will he drop the interest rates? Will he allow the money printing to occur? Yes. I believe he will. Does that mean that silver and gold will go up? I believe it does. I don't think this is done yet.

1215
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:26.870
That's my contention.

1216
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:29.750
But every single announcement

1217
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:34.150
the the US government has done in the past year has Yes. Crushed the markets.

1218
01:13:35.145 --> 01:13:38.985
So glad you brought that up. Yeah. I don't think they have anything.

1219
01:13:39.385 --> 01:13:45.864
I think that's a symptom of the weakness of the market. The fact that any statement that any politician

1220
01:13:45.865 --> 01:13:49.460
or someone somewhat aligned with that says

1221
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.059
spooks the market,

1222
01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.739
at least temporarily,

1223
01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.900
that is a sign of weakness.

1224
01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:00.579
Yeah. Makes sense. And I think as we go further and further into this, that will become

1225
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.219
look.

1226
01:14:04.295 --> 01:14:05.735
When when

1227
01:14:05.815 --> 01:14:06.534
the,

1228
01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:08.215
when the German,

1229
01:14:08.614 --> 01:14:09.735
mark

1230
01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:19.019
post World War one went into the toilet, the Weimar Republic as everyone calls it. Right? All the money money printing. Their market

1231
01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.940
was crazy.

1232
01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.179
Like it would up down up down up down up down. Like it was this

1233
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:25.900
the

1234
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.780
the stock market which operated during that entire time period, it was insane.

1235
01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:35.584
People became rich because they managed to catch the right things.

1236
01:14:35.824 --> 01:14:36.864
But you know,

1237
01:14:37.344 --> 01:14:40.145
but there was so much back. It's it it

1238
01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:42.385
we're not to that level

1239
01:14:42.704 --> 01:14:48.909
but it does remind me of that and I I don't know. Maybe I'm going out on limb. Alright. We need to move on.

1240
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:52.030
Kenshin hates The US.

1241
01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:53.230
Yeah.

1242
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:54.750
Silver's going up.

1243
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.214
Yeah. I think that covers it.

1244
01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:00.414
Yes.

1245
01:15:01.934 --> 01:15:03.374
I may be wrong. I

1246
01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:13.809
I have I know you don't like this. I I I'm really upset with US. That that is true for many reasons the last few years, and and this doesn't help.

1247
01:15:14.449 --> 01:15:22.289
But, yeah, I remember we said at the beginning of of of this government, we said, is it better to have an anti Bitcoin,

1248
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:23.969
US Government,

1249
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:24.689
or

1250
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.969
a meme coin?

1251
01:15:27.454 --> 01:15:31.454
US government. And right now think it depends on on how long

1252
01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:35.135
what anti Bitcoin means. If they wanna make it illegal,

1253
01:15:35.534 --> 01:15:38.334
Bitcoin is going to continue, but it would hurt.

1254
01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:47.100
It would definitely hurt. Yeah. But now we're we're we're going up and down like the the stock market so Yeah. We're

1255
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.139
not done separating from Fiat. We're just not. No.

1256
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.699
It's And that's okay. Feel more attached than ever to Fiat because Maybe.

1257
01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.364
Because of the attachment now to Wall Street.

1258
01:15:58.605 --> 01:16:06.364
Yeah. I agree. So that's what I don't like. Alright. We got a few more things. In case you didn't know, the government the US government,

1259
01:16:06.685 --> 01:16:07.565
Kenshin's favorite,

1260
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.559
seized $400,000,000

1261
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.480
in Bitcoin linked to what's called the Helix Mixer.

1262
01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:15.519
Yeah.

1263
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.599
It's a dark net mixer.

1264
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.160
That's

1265
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.334
the details I got. It's not a whole lot. It was in Bitcoin Magazine. There was an article about it.

1266
01:16:26.135 --> 01:16:28.374
Yeah. I I saw that they

1267
01:16:29.175 --> 01:16:31.334
they were threatening that guy

1268
01:16:31.574 --> 01:16:36.855
who made that mixer for twenty years in prison and then

1269
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.260
he pleaded guilty and so

1270
01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.420
yeah. He gave it up and settled for, like, three years or something.

1271
01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.220
But but they took all his Bitcoin.

1272
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.820
Yeah. So I think they just got to him with So

1273
01:16:49.245 --> 01:16:54.285
this is a problem with a strategic Bitcoin reserve that can be

1274
01:16:54.925 --> 01:16:55.805
built

1275
01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:56.605
by

1276
01:16:58.365 --> 01:16:59.245
seizures,

1277
01:16:59.245 --> 01:17:01.645
by criminal what they would call criminal seizures.

1278
01:17:01.725 --> 01:17:05.860
I don't know this case. I'm not I don't know but

1279
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.340
you know they've

1280
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.540
put him in jail

1281
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.580
and now they've

1282
01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.619
got his Bitcoin.

1283
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.900
A lot of it $400,000,000

1284
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.945
worth. Yeah. It's crazy.

1285
01:17:20.145 --> 01:17:23.104
Look, ladies and gentlemen, in case I've not said it enough,

1286
01:17:23.824 --> 01:17:26.385
there's not enough privacy built into Bitcoin.

1287
01:17:26.705 --> 01:17:29.905
And it's not just for people like this. It's for you and me as well.

1288
01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:34.770
That is one of the biggest weaknesses of Bitcoin in my opinion.

1289
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.250
They arrest I thought this was interesting.

1290
01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:51.095
And maybe this is because of the recent change in government in Venezuela because of The United States, but an Argentine crypto fugitive was arrested in Venezuela with $56,000,000

1291
01:17:51.095 --> 01:17:54.935
in Bitcoin. So this kinda goes back to the case we just talked about.

1292
01:17:55.655 --> 01:18:02.800
But obviously, there was a lot of cooperation here. This person left one country, went to another thinking, I'll be safe over here.

1293
01:18:03.519 --> 01:18:05.119
And turns out they weren't.

1294
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.880
Tennessee lawmakers, do want I like to bring this stuff up because I like to see the states build Bitcoin reserves.

1295
01:18:16.075 --> 01:18:20.155
Tennessee is considering a a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill

1296
01:18:20.795 --> 01:18:23.195
as well. Considering is the keywords.

1297
01:18:23.515 --> 01:18:24.155
Yeah.

1298
01:18:24.715 --> 01:18:25.435
Yeah.

1299
01:18:25.995 --> 01:18:26.875
How

1300
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:27.995
did that end up in there?

1301
01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:31.450
Hold on. I

1302
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:34.650
some of my other stuff ended up in there.

1303
01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:38.010
I was talking to Chad GPT, did you read that?

1304
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:39.690
I

1305
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:41.290
did. I asked him if I was crazy.

1306
01:18:42.105 --> 01:18:43.465
It told me no.

1307
01:18:46.425 --> 01:18:50.505
It's a grizzly thing. I had to believe it. No, I was talking to it about the Claude

1308
01:18:51.065 --> 01:18:51.945
Claude bot. Alright,

1309
01:18:52.425 --> 01:18:52.824
Sorry

1310
01:18:54.345 --> 01:18:58.630
about that. And then, yeah, let's skip that last one. I think we're good to go.

1311
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.790
Bitcoin price

1312
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:02.230
as we record.

1313
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.989
Not

1314
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.909
so good.

1315
01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:09.430
74,790

1316
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:10.710
USD

1317
01:19:10.395 --> 01:19:13.114
and €63,500.

1318
01:19:14.075 --> 01:19:18.235
Yeah. I woke up in the morning, it was €66,500.

1319
01:19:18.235 --> 01:19:18.795
Just

1320
01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:25.114
dropped 3,000 during the day. Yep. So what do we have right now? Cheap sats.

1321
01:19:25.355 --> 01:19:27.609
Cheap sats. Go buy some sats.

1322
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:32.089
Yeah. It's very tempting to just Buy that 1 tenth of a Bitcoin.

1323
01:19:32.889 --> 01:19:45.385
Yeah. Financial advice. Don't do it if you got other things to that you need to buy, ladies and gentlemen, It's that expression to look between the couch pillows. Right? Anything extra. Any extra chains I

1324
01:19:46.345 --> 01:19:55.280
think Kitchen and I both believe that well, know we both believe that there's a very strong level at 70,000 basically which was the previous all time high.

1325
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.640
Yeah. That

1326
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.880
historically

1327
01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.719
has never been broken,

1328
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.520
I believe.

1329
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.239
Yeah.

1330
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:10.455
At least for a few cycles before that. Let me put it that way before I get myself in trouble.

1331
01:20:11.255 --> 01:20:13.895
We have approached that level multiple times.

1332
01:20:14.695 --> 01:20:16.215
We've never touched it.

1333
01:20:17.015 --> 01:20:23.175
We got down to 73 or 71 recently I'm not sure and you've got the chart there but

1334
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:26.429
know got down to 73,

1335
01:20:26.429 --> 01:20:26.909
yeah.

1336
01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:34.829
So far this has proven to be a very strong level. If it breaks this, I don't know what's gonna happen but I do know I'm gonna be buying Bitcoin.

1337
01:20:36.175 --> 01:20:43.855
I'm not stopping. I'm not stopping my DCA. I love every Sunday when I wake up and look at my thing and it's like, oh, there's

1338
01:20:44.095 --> 01:20:45.935
x number more Satoshis.

1339
01:20:46.415 --> 01:20:47.055
Mhmm.

1340
01:20:47.855 --> 01:20:54.210
Yeah. Right now, you're right. And the DCA is you get more satoshis now every DCA.

1341
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:56.210
It's more such.

1342
01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.010
Zoom out like I always say, people.

1343
01:20:59.410 --> 01:21:05.330
Price last February 3, in case you wanna know, we might wanna stop doing this. Yes.

1344
01:21:07.635 --> 01:21:13.315
No. It was a $101.04 $0.05, meaning we are down 26.25%.

1345
01:21:14.195 --> 01:21:17.875
Ladies and gentlemen, if this is the bear market, I laugh at it.

1346
01:21:18.435 --> 01:21:19.475
I laugh at it.

1347
01:21:20.599 --> 01:21:22.760
Yeah. Remember our previous,

1348
01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:24.840
cycle

1349
01:21:26.119 --> 01:21:27.239
analysis.

1350
01:21:27.559 --> 01:21:28.599
So then

1351
01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:33.400
the bottom of this bear cycle bear market should be October.

1352
01:21:34.074 --> 01:21:38.794
Yeah. And I'm bit surprised if we can stay in this level.

1353
01:21:39.355 --> 01:21:41.675
The further along we get,

1354
01:21:42.715 --> 01:21:46.715
the more I believe that this was a four we saw the four year cycle.

1355
01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.920
We hit the time,

1356
01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.079
October 6.

1357
01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.400
Yeah. Did not hit the price.

1358
01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.440
But that's what Bitcoin does. It teases you and then it's like, nope. Not gonna do it.

1359
01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.080
Yeah.

1360
01:22:04.264 --> 01:22:05.465
But it's

1361
01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:08.505
cheap sats. I think cheap sats. That's my shirt.

1362
01:22:08.824 --> 01:22:10.744
Sure. Shirt for the cheap sats.

1363
01:22:11.465 --> 01:22:14.585
Apparently, no one wants a shirt that says we are the network.

1364
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.840
So I guess we'll give that up.

1365
01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.440
If I were a rich bitcoin

1366
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.600
person, I'd be like doing all I'd just be like, give me that shirt.

1367
01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:29.784
Cheapsats.

1368
01:22:31.304 --> 01:22:32.104
Alright.

1369
01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.665
Bitcoin market cap, 1,500,000,000,000.0

1370
01:22:34.665 --> 01:22:35.465
US.

1371
01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:38.184
Gold market cap, 34,100,000,000,000.0.

1372
01:22:39.145 --> 01:22:41.145
I can't read that number. You do it.

1373
01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:47.260
Bitcoin versus gold market cap. We're below five at 4.3%.

1374
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.500
So depressing. Last

1375
01:22:50.140 --> 01:23:01.235
time I saw below five, that was like two years ago or something. We will catch up, ladies and gentlemen. It is only a matter of time and I'm not full of hopium.

1376
01:23:01.635 --> 01:23:06.594
It's the truth. Yeah. But I need to fix that bot as

1377
01:23:07.715 --> 01:23:11.139
Mike has suggested us many times. Yeah. I

1378
01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:17.940
only have one last thing I wanna talk about. Let's go ahead and wrap this up because we're getting long.

1379
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.659
Last week,

1380
01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.740
what did we say? Like 18%

1381
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:28.405
down is what it was looking like? We are four days out from the next difficulty adjustment.

1382
01:23:28.485 --> 01:23:31.844
We are still minus 14.42%

1383
01:23:31.844 --> 01:23:33.524
if it happened right now.

1384
01:23:34.085 --> 01:23:34.885
Meaning

1385
01:23:34.965 --> 01:23:38.405
not minors are not online. My minors are online,

1386
01:23:38.485 --> 01:23:40.005
but minors are not online

1387
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:41.130
and

1388
01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:44.809
I'm okay with that.

1389
01:23:45.449 --> 01:23:47.690
We we are 251

1390
01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.530
blocks behind schedule.

1391
01:23:50.410 --> 01:23:52.330
That's

1392
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:55.244
it. That's the show. That's what we got.

1393
01:23:56.445 --> 01:23:58.445
Anything else you wanna throw in?

1394
01:23:59.005 --> 01:23:59.805
TikTok.

1395
01:23:59.805 --> 01:24:03.804
Next block. It still works. It still works. There's one.

1396
01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:12.090
There's one. There was four in that ten minutes before the show. Just now. We are at block nine three four eight nine six.

1397
01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:17.050
You're gonna confuse the AI. It's gonna be like, I don't know which block to use.

1398
01:24:21.369 --> 01:24:22.010
Satoshi.

1399
01:24:23.985 --> 01:24:25.985
Hey. We're talking about AI again.

1408
01:25:02.975 --> 01:25:09.999
Joe Martin, I hope you appreciate this. This week's music is empty passenger seat because Macintosh did not change it.

1409
01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.800
I was too busy working on the news or something. Any boost for streaming of Sats during that song will go straight to the artist.

1410
01:25:18.045 --> 01:25:28.925
Yeah. So thanks again for joining us in the AI Plebs podcast this week. You'll hear you'll
