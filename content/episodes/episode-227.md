In episode 227, McIntosh and Kenshin examine Executive Order 6102 from 1933, when FDR forced Americans to surrender their gold at $20.67 per ounce before the government revalued it to $35, creating a massive wealth transfer. They debate whether a similar Bitcoin confiscation could occur, discussing how centralized exchanges would be vulnerable while self-custodied Bitcoin presents unique enforcement challenges since it exists as cryptographic keys rather than physical asset and compare the regulatory environments between the US and Europe.

Stick around to the very end for Send It Mike's  track, “Freedom Code Revolution”.
