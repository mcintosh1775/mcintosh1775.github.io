McIntosh:00:00:01Hey, sat stackers. It's November 23rd, and this is episode 146 of Generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, McIntosh,

00:00:07And today's episode

00:00:09is Happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:40Before we jump into the market app update, just want to wish everybody,

00:00:45Certainly here in the United States, a Happy Thanksgiving,

00:00:48as we celebrate Thanksgiving today.

00:00:51I'm recording this,

00:00:53you know, 10:30 in the morning. We'll be leaving, going over to,

00:00:58family here in another hour and a half.

00:01:01I don't think I'll get this edited before I get out. If I do, it'll be up. If not, it'll be out later this afternoon.

00:01:08Regardless,

00:01:09it's getting recorded on Thanksgiving,

00:01:12and,

00:01:14I am thankful

00:01:16for many

00:01:20For many things in my life,

00:01:22including

00:01:23my listeners, so thank you.

00:01:25We'll start with our market update.

00:01:27Right now, as I record, Bitcoin is at 37,116.

00:01:32Our block height

00:01:34It's 818-129.

00:01:36That's 818,129.

00:01:43Let me jot that down in my notes.

00:01:46Now that is not very different from our recording

00:01:51on

00:01:52the

00:01:5319th.

00:01:55But in between,

00:01:57we did take a big drop.

00:02:00It basically,

00:02:01ironically,

00:02:02did exactly

00:02:03what I said. I'm not a genius at this, and and this is not trading advice.

00:02:08Of course,

00:02:10Patterns are patterns. I've done this long enough that I can I can see them,

00:02:14and it's just fun to do this to have a general idea of how things are going? You should never trade based off this. Of course, here at d c

00:02:21at Generation Bitcoin, what do we talk about? We talk about DCA and your Bitcoin.

00:02:26Just dollar cost average it. Buy it every day. Use something like Strike,

00:02:31or if you could maybe

00:02:32trade for sets at a

00:02:34Bitcoin meetup, this kind of thing.

00:02:37Get that Bitcoin,

00:02:38as frequently as you can and just don't worry about the cost,

00:02:43the price of Bitcoin, I should say. So I'm looking at this chart. So, again, last week, we were talking about an upward channel that's developed developed,

00:02:52which is a bullish flag,

00:02:54Basically,

00:02:55right after I recorded so on Monday, Tuesday, after we recorded, we fell quite a bit, And then Wednesday, we went right back up.

00:03:05And then today, it's just kind of been muddling along. Now interestingly, we are under a Line of resistance at 37,500

00:03:13that I've had on this chart for I don't know how long.

00:03:16I do not know. It goes back

00:03:19a long way.

00:03:20I don't remember exactly when I put it there, but it was

00:03:24some time ago.

00:03:26And for 3 days, we have stayed under that other than brief,

00:03:31wicks above as they show on the chart.

00:03:35So

00:03:36this is proving to be a little bit of a resistance.

00:03:40Probably what we'll do

00:03:42Well, we'll see. I'm not gonna predict. I don't I don't want you guys to think that I'm starting to make chart predictions and I don't know. Whatever.

00:03:50People start relying on me and trading on me. Look. I'm not trading on this, just to be clear.

00:03:57So, Anyways,

00:03:58we we are at this point of resistance.

00:04:02I do think that we'll ultimately get on through.

00:04:05We may go back down onto the bottom of the of the upward channel. I'll go ahead and put this chart up on,

00:04:13on Twitter. I post these occasionally. I'll go ahead and take a screenshot

00:04:17so that you can

00:04:19see what I'm talking about. I'll do that right now.

00:04:22And if you look

00:04:25if you look at this picture, you'll be able to see exactly what I'm talking about. We've spent

00:04:31A few days now

00:04:33well, we're on our 3rd day under this line of resistance at 37,500.

00:04:38And I didn't just arbitrarily

00:04:40draw that line on there. I'd have I'd have to look back to see when I had drawn that and why. I don't remember, to be honest.

McIntosh:00:04:48The yellow gray is hot. I just made it,

00:04:51and I needed it this morning since I'm

00:04:55Recording

McIntosh:00:04:57so early.

00:04:59Let's see. Must be that one. There it is.

00:05:02Got it.

00:05:04And I'm just simply labeling this today's chart action.

00:05:11We'll confuse everybody on Twitter,

00:05:13but you'll know. So you can see thre days well, really four days of resistance at that 35,000,

00:05:21Our 37,500

00:05:22level, you can see the two sides of this ascending channel,

00:05:27in orange. You can see the Bollinger Bands

00:05:30There as well in light blue, the curvy kinda line

00:05:35that kinda snakes around, and then you see the blue line there of that resistance at 37,500.

00:05:42There's more resistance up above that.

00:05:44As you can see

00:05:46let me look at the bigger chart,

00:05:49at 38284,

00:05:52so 383,

00:05:54and then basically 40,000 up there as well.

00:05:57You can very clearly see that. And I think what we'll see is we'll drop back down to somewhere around 36,

00:06:04kinda like what we did a couple of days ago.

00:06:07It's possible, but this resistance proves to be strong enough to do that. But until we break this lower

00:06:14Ascending channel, we will continue to grind up. We may go all the way over here in December,

00:06:20early December,

00:06:21To basically wear that 37,500

00:06:25and that line of resistance or, excuse me, that ascending channel meet

00:06:31and and push on up at that point. I

00:06:34I suspect before then, we will have moved up to the upper part of the Ascending triangle and tried to break out. Well, we'll see.

00:06:44Interesting stuff. Interesting stuff. Next difficulty adjustment, November 25th. So coming up, and we're looking at a 4% adjustment. Man, there's just people are just throwing

00:06:54throwing

00:06:55hash power on the network.

00:06:58I, as a miner, just man, it's just it's bad.

00:07:021.22

00:07:03gigabytes

00:07:04of transactions.

00:07:06This is our saving grace because there's plenty of transactions.

00:07:10Transaction fees are high,

00:07:15and they remain that way. I've been trying to do some things, and,

00:07:19I may just have to bite the bullet and do it. I'm cheap. I'll wait for a while, but yeah.

00:07:25There you go.

00:07:284.05%

00:07:29difficulty adjustment.

00:07:31And

00:07:32if you recall,

00:07:34That last adjustment was 3.55.

00:07:39So we've gone up more than 2%

00:07:44and since just three days in

00:07:46that difficulty estimate.

00:07:49Alright.

00:07:50We'll go ahead and move on from there. Oh, you can follow me on Twitter at McintoshFintech.

00:07:55It's

00:07:56Mcintosh,

00:07:57f I n t e c h. So you can see that chart. Just pop on over there

00:08:01and take a look.

00:08:03What are we gonna talk about today? I posted something earlier this week that I thought was really important,

00:08:11and

McIntosh:00:08:12we're gonna talk about it.

McIntosh:00:08:14It might be a little obtuse

00:08:17for many of you,

00:08:19but it's important, and I'll explain why.

00:08:23I've talked about this in different angles

00:08:26Over

00:08:27time,

00:08:29but Bitcoin is a censorship resistant,

00:08:32decentralized,

00:08:35Nongovernmental controlled,

00:08:38network. What did I post earlier today? We somebody well, actually, it was in regards

McIntosh:00:08:45to this, so let me just just dig right in.

McIntosh:00:08:49By the way,

00:08:51I I'm not really gonna report on this, but Binance,

00:08:55the

00:08:56CEO of Binance, CZ, has been forced to step down. This was by the SEC, a deal that they made,

00:09:03basically

00:09:04pleading guilty

00:09:06to some charges by the justice

00:09:08Department paying a huge fine, which for him isn't really that big, but it was a significant amount.

00:09:15I don't know. Not really my cup of tea.

00:09:19I didn't wanna mention that, I suppose. I suppose it's news

00:09:23on November 22nd, so just yesterday.

McIntosh:00:09:27That's right. He deleted it.

00:09:30Darn.

McIntosh:00:09:31Okay. Well, I'm gonna have to improvise. I showed a screenshot.

00:09:34Taking a screenshot of it.

00:09:36I did not.

00:09:39Of course, he did. Alright.

McIntosh:00:09:42As everybody knows that listens to this podcast, I use brains mining pool. I mentioned this from time to time. I like brains. It's a great mining pool. It's actually the oldest public mining pool

McIntosh:00:09:55in existence.

00:09:56What a mining pool is

00:09:58Is a way for

00:10:01so with Bitcoin with Bitcoin mining, it's become so difficult to mine a block.

00:10:06Essentially,

McIntosh:00:10:08miners have started banding together, and this happened a long time ago,

00:10:12to pull their resources

00:10:14and mine.

00:10:15And then when somebody in the pool actually does mind that block,

00:10:20they share it.

00:10:22So it's it's cooperative,

00:10:24And it's a way to,

00:10:27you know, potentially not go for years without buying a block of Bitcoin.

McIntosh:00:10:32I'll just pull up bit

00:10:34brains. It's b r a I I I n s.

00:10:38I I always get that wrong. I put 2 n's.

McIntosh:00:10:42And just as a

McIntosh:00:10:44point of reference to give you some statistics,

00:10:48they are showing

00:10:519,376

00:10:53active users, so that's minors. They are showing

00:10:5770,798

00:11:00active workers.

00:11:01So that's, like, 8 actual a six per miner, if that makes sense, per person.

00:11:07And then the total aggregate

00:11:09hash rate is 6.297,

00:11:12so 6.3

00:11:13Exashash.

00:11:16So

00:11:18the amount that you make when a block gets mined

00:11:21varies

00:11:22depending on how many minors that you, how many ASICs that you have running in the mining pool. Now

00:11:29here's the trick.

00:11:30Even with 6.3 Exashash, which is a decent amount, there's a total, by the way, of, like, 450 Exashash.

00:11:38This is,

00:11:39around, like, 1 a half, 2%

00:11:41of the total.

00:11:43There's a statistic that I've seen recently. It's something like that. It's 1 point something

00:11:48Percent. Not very big, which means

00:11:51basically, one out of a 100 blocks gets mined

00:11:56in the brain's mining pool.

00:11:58And if you look at a chart, you know,

00:12:01even with 70,000

00:12:03active workers, we still

00:12:05there are days when we don't get a block. We went we mined a block on 17th, and then we mined a block, 2 blocks, actually, on the 21st.

00:12:15Actually, I think we mined three blocks on 17th, but then the 18th, 19th, 20th For 3 days, which is the longest that I've seen,

00:12:24we went without mining a block. So even in a mining pool,

00:12:28It's it's not easy.

00:12:30It's not easy, but that's okay.

00:12:33This is the life we choose. Right?

00:12:35Here's the point to all this.

00:12:37These mining pools

00:12:40to an extent control things, and they're very important.

00:12:44We don't want,

00:12:45for example,

00:12:47Maybe one country, the United States, for example, having too much mining power.

00:12:52Now that doesn't necessarily mean the Servers are hosted in the United States. It means that the mining pools are. Those mining pools are a centralized point

00:13:02that the government, if you want, or a corporate

00:13:06entity,

00:13:07could seek to control.

00:13:09So these are super important, and we always wanna be careful about them.

00:13:13So one of the things that we've had going on

00:13:16Is this OFAC

00:13:18compliant

00:13:19transactions

00:13:21list or whatever, Bitcoin list? And what this means is that

00:13:25there's this

00:13:27entity,

00:13:29which I don't even know what OFAC stands for.

00:13:33The office of foreign assets control

00:13:37administers and enforces economic sanctions

00:13:41primarily against countries and groups of individuals such as terrorists and narcotics traders.

00:13:47Oh my gosh. Where did your money come from?

00:13:50You're laundering money for x, y, or z.

00:13:54This

00:13:56bureaucratic body

00:13:58Has come up with a list,

00:14:01Bitcoin addresses

00:14:03that they say

00:14:05Are being used by

00:14:07North Korea, for example.

00:14:09I know North Korea happens to be on their list

00:14:12because the North Korean government,

00:14:14God forbid is engaged in Bitcoin mining and or whatever,

00:14:20hacking. Let's just make it really evil.

00:14:23And those

00:14:24Bitcoin were illicitly gained.

00:14:27Cue the music.

00:14:29Right?

00:14:30So we're gonna make a list,

00:14:32and then you,

00:14:34mining pool, you're going to

McIntosh:00:14:36you're going to

00:14:38Monitor

00:14:39for those

McIntosh:00:14:40transactions. You see where this is going. Right? And then if that Bitcoin,

00:14:45You're gonna monitor for those Bitcoin in it. And if those Bitcoin are used in a transaction, you are to block it. You are to not allow that in your mining pool.

00:14:56Now first of all,

McIntosh:00:14:58there's 90,000

00:15:00miners, or what did I say?

00:15:0270,000 minors. There's 9,000

00:15:05active miners.

00:15:07It's not the mining pool's

00:15:10responsibility

00:15:12To be censoring, and let's be clear, that's what we're doing,

00:15:16these transactions.

00:15:19The miners

00:15:20can choose

00:15:22to do that.

00:15:24The mining pool should not have that option.

00:15:27And yet earlier this week, that's exactly what we saw.

00:15:31I called it out as soon as I saw it.

McIntosh:00:15:34Satoshifish from the f2 mining pool, which is,

00:15:38I believe, an American mining pool,

00:15:41posted saying

00:15:43Some somebody and people monitor

00:15:46Bitcoin transactions.

00:15:48Somebody noticed

00:15:50that

00:15:51they were not mining

00:15:52certain

00:15:53transactions.

00:15:55They were censoring them, and they called him out on it. And he said, well, yes. I'm not mining

00:16:02Chinese transactions or,

00:16:04I know explicitly

00:16:06he

00:16:07mentioned,

00:16:09North Korea

00:16:10and Xi

00:16:12Jinping. And I hope I said that right. The premier of China. He says, we're not mining terrorists,

00:16:18or we're not transacting terrorist Bitcoin,

00:16:21this kind of thing. And, unfortunately, he's deleted the tweet, of course, because he got such quick backlash from it. But this is the 1st known case of this happening.

00:16:32And I was frankly pleasantly surprised because a lot of people don't understand the nuance of this. It's just a knee jerk reaction. Oh, North Korea bad. Yes. Ban them. Ban them. Ban them. Russia, bad. Ban them. Ban them. Right?

00:16:47We're gonna engage in economic warfare.

00:16:50That's not what so we're just moving from the physical to the economic.

00:16:55Look.

00:16:57Bitcoin doesn't care, and I've gone over this so many times. It doesn't care what color you are,

00:17:02what religion you are, what country you live in,

McIntosh:00:17:06what your social status is,

00:17:08so on and so forth. Bitcoin doesn't care. If you have electricity,

00:17:14if you have Internet,

00:17:16and if you have an ASIC, you can mine Bitcoin.

00:17:19You can use Bitcoin

00:17:21in a

00:17:23censorship resistant way

00:17:25to make transactions. We're past the point where

00:17:29people like this can stop

00:17:32this stuff from happening. See, the problem is

McIntosh:00:17:35You don't know what's going on there.

00:17:37We know that

00:17:39chain analysis is not perfect. We know that,

00:17:42You know, anybody in

00:17:44North Korea, people are very creative. We've seen this in places where there's

00:17:49harsh regimes.

00:17:51Places like,

00:17:53Venezuela,

00:17:54places like Cuba,

00:17:56where Bitcoin miners are kind of pirating,

00:18:00guerrilla,

00:18:01whatever you wanna call it, style

00:18:03Bitcoin mining and making

00:18:06Bitcoin. Why would we block

00:18:09their Bitcoin just because they live

00:18:12in a place that we don't agree with. How are we ever gonna have free trade

00:18:18And good world relations,

00:18:20if we block countries based on

00:18:23well, I don't agree with you over x, y, or z. I don't agree with North Korea. I don't.

00:18:29I don't agree with the regime of North Korea. I think that's pretty straightforward,

00:18:35But why would I block

00:18:37all of their ability to transact with

00:18:41the international

00:18:43Market.

00:18:44If

00:18:45if blockades work,

McIntosh:00:18:47Cuba would be a paradise.

00:18:49It used to be back in the fifties.

00:18:52See, this is this is

McIntosh:00:18:56no, dear listener. I was not around back in the fifties,

00:19:00but it was.

00:19:02When Fidel Castro

00:19:04and I hope I get this history correct. I think I will be. When Fidel Castro

00:19:09took over

00:19:10and buddied up with the Soviets, and that part may I may be not

McIntosh:00:19:15exactly getting correct, but I think this is fairly accurate.

00:19:19That's when we

00:19:21did

00:19:22a blockade, and

00:19:23I believe the rest of the world,

McIntosh:00:19:26like Western Europe, I should say. Went along with it for a while, and then they said no, and

00:19:32they've gone on and done business, but we continued our blockade to this day.

00:19:37We're just now opening up here and there. I know during Obama's

00:19:43Presidency,

00:19:44they opened up airlines for a while, and then I think that got closed. I mean, it's it's crazy.

00:19:49It's like we're punishing these people.

00:19:52In theory, we're punishing Castro or whoever I think Castro's dead.

00:19:57I'm not sure who replaced him. That's sad. I should know that. But, You know, we're we're play we're punishing the government, really.

00:20:06But really what we're doing is we're punishing

00:20:09the people.

00:20:11Because whoever's in charge,

00:20:14they make deals and do things and and and they do okay.

00:20:19They may do really good,

00:20:21but the poor farmer

00:20:22who can't get fertilizer

00:20:25because of the US blockade,

00:20:27Not to get on a side trail here, but actually,

00:20:31organic farming

00:20:33in Cuba

00:20:34has become

00:20:35very big simply because they could not get artificial fertilizer.

00:20:39Anyways,

00:20:40you know,

00:20:41It didn't help them

00:20:43is my point,

McIntosh:00:20:46but here we are doing it again

McIntosh:00:20:48or at least we're attempting to.

00:20:51So I said f 2 pool cofounder,

00:20:54and he was is the cofounder, ladies and gentlemen. So f2 pool, cofounder, ladies and gentlemen. Looks like f2 pool is now censoring transactions.

00:21:03Time to vote with your miners, fellow plebs. Like I said earlier, come join us over at Braiins Pool,

00:21:09or Braiins Mining Pool. And I

00:21:11Posted something about braiins earlier. I don't even remember.

00:21:14But, you know,

00:21:16it's very easy.

00:21:18Let's say I had a 1,000 minors. I do I do not. God, I wished I did.

00:21:23Let's say I had a 1,000 miners.

McIntosh:00:21:25I could change the pool, you know, very quickly.

00:21:29Just switch.

McIntosh:00:21:31As minors, we don't have to put up with this because I promise you

00:21:35as a as a minor in that f2 pool, that that will not be helpful for you in the end.

McIntosh:00:21:42And in fact, for the pools that do not censor

00:21:47transactions,

00:21:48they will benefit.

00:21:50People will move to braiins. Brains will become a bigger pool, which will make it a little more stable, so to speak.

McIntosh:00:21:56I thought that was important. I wanted to draw that out, actually.

00:22:02I tell you what, guys.

00:22:03I'm just gonna go ahead and stop there. I've been going on for about 15, 20 minutes. I I'm gonna go ahead and,

00:22:10I'm gonna leave it at that. That may be a little more than Kinda what y'all really

00:22:15want.

00:22:15I don't wanna turn this into a mining podcast, but just like nodes, Bitcoin nodes, these miners are

00:22:23a super important part of the network. Sensoring does not need to take place,

00:22:29plain and simple. Just don't do it because it's a very slippery slope,

00:22:34and you do not know who you're affecting.

00:22:38And regardless of my feelings for whoever the leader of Cuba is currently,

00:22:44which I think is Oh, man. I'm gonna look this up.

00:22:48I think it's Castro's brother,

McIntosh:00:22:52but we're gonna find out. Yes. No.

McIntosh:00:22:55Who is the 3rd and current 1st secretary, so that's like the president. Okay. Yeah.

00:23:01So, no, it was not. It's

00:23:03Alright. Miguel

00:23:04Mario Diaz

00:23:06Conley e Bermudez.

00:23:09Bermudez

00:23:11like Bermuda.

00:23:13Sorry, buddy.

00:23:14I think I butchered that one.

00:23:16Is a Cuban politician an engineer who is the 3rd and current first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba. So I believe it was Castro, Fidel, and and then his brother, which

00:23:28Maybe Miguel?

00:23:29But, no, I'm probably pulling that from this guy. I do not remember his name.

00:23:34For a brief period of time, they both died if I'm not mistaken.

00:23:38I know Castro did. Fidel. I when I say Castro, I mean Fidel.

00:23:43I apologize if that's disrespectful. I don't really think it is, but I call Biden our president Biden. Biden all the time.

McIntosh:00:23:51Trump for that matter. I don't care.

McIntosh:00:23:53Yeah. So Castro and then his brother and then I think this guy. So he's now the 1st secretary.

00:23:59Regardless of my feelings for him and, you know, his policies and whatever, I'm more worried about the Cuban people,

00:24:06and I love to see that there is a Bitcoin community that is starting to flourish in Cuba, by the way. I've talked about that a little bit before. Alright.

00:24:15Enough about that. Let's roll right into

00:24:21Supporters.

00:24:22Yeah. Awesome.

00:24:23While I'm bringing this up, just,

00:24:28You know, where does this all lead? I don't I don't know.

00:24:31We know that, you know, these governments, these

00:24:35Bureaucratic,

00:24:36regulatory

00:24:37companies,

00:24:39entities

00:24:40like like OFAC, you know, they're going to be pushing.

00:24:44We know that.

00:24:45And and and our job really is to push back.

00:24:50So I don't know what form that takes,

00:24:54But my miners and my nodes will not be censoring.

00:25:00And, ultimately, if that means that I have to move them,

00:25:04you know, to a hosting provider, say,

00:25:07In Europe

00:25:09or in South America,

00:25:11then that's what they do.

00:25:14I'm good with that. It's too important.

00:25:16I hope y'all realize that that's kind of the way I'm wired at this point.

00:25:21Maybe maybe you don't,

00:25:23and that's okay. But,

00:25:27these things really are important. So, anyways,

00:25:31Something to keep in mind as we watch this develop.

00:25:34This was all in relation to did Argentina

00:25:36win.

00:25:38I will be keeping tabs

00:25:40on president,

00:25:42Malay who will take office in early December. I think it's, like, December 5th

00:25:47on his goings on. We had 2 boosts this week, though. We had an anonymous boost. I I I think we've got a regular anonymous listener. It's awesome.

00:25:56500

00:25:57sets, boost, no message.

00:26:00Friend, if you ever wanna tell me anything, just, boost away. If you do well,

00:26:06That's kind of public, but,

00:26:08you can always email me at McIntosh@gendashbtc.com.

00:26:13That will change early next year, although I will probably keep that email set up for a while.

00:26:19But, yeah, you can always send me a message if you'd like that way.

00:26:23So I appreciate that anonymous. And then also,

00:26:27Kyrin

00:26:28at Mere Mortals,

00:26:31sent in, his kinda regular,

00:26:342222

00:26:35row of ducks,

00:26:36boost.

00:26:37And,

00:26:39yeah. I'll I'll read this out. Appreciate this, Kyron.

00:26:42He said I was just playing Macintosh.

00:26:45Balance is never the answer. Respect you greatly for that. Also, a healthy reminder

00:26:49that politicians talk more than they actually do. Amen to that, brother.

00:26:54Hope he can fix some things up.

00:26:57Talking about delay.

00:26:58But individual actions will solve problems more than any politician.

00:27:04I generally

00:27:05I generally

00:27:07Find politics

00:27:08to just be a complete waste of time. I yeah.

00:27:11I appreciate that.

00:27:13I'm kinda there myself

00:27:15in a lot of ways,

00:27:17And he was listening via podcast guru, by the way,

00:27:20which is

00:27:21I like it. It's pretty good.

00:27:24Pretty good little program, but,

00:27:27In general, I agree.

00:27:29I think

00:27:30as we see the breakdown of fiat in these countries, though,

00:27:35I'm hoping. Let me put it this way. There's

00:27:38y'all may find this hard to believe. I'm actually a positive person inside.

00:27:42Maybe sometimes they don't sound like it.

00:27:45I'm hoping

00:27:47I'm I'm hoping

00:27:49that there are politicians who come along.

00:27:52We need people to take control, and I don't mean like as dictators.

McIntosh:00:27:57But we need people to stop fooling around,

McIntosh:00:28:01And, you know, making a bunch of money while they're in their 4 or 8 year time frame or 12 years or whatever,

00:28:08And in general, screwing the public, excuse me for saying that, but yeah.

00:28:14I don't know if Milei will be that. I'm not even convinced that Bukele in El Salvador is that. He

00:28:22has done a lot of good things. It remains to be seen

00:28:25how he will respond in the coming years. Now I believe he's running for reelection,

00:28:31which there's even controversy about that.

00:28:34I do know that a lot of good things have happened down there. Now I'm not one to say, well,

00:28:40the good things are gonna outweigh any bad Things that that person does. So we will just

00:28:45have to wait and see.

00:28:47But I do hope because

00:28:50these countries are, I mean, just and I I talk about the United States a lot

00:28:55because it's where I live, but but there's countries all over the world that are a mess. The The EU is a mess. Let's be honest. It's a mess.

00:29:03Now that particular pickle, I don't know how they're gonna get out of because it's Such a bureaucratic

00:29:08tangle of

00:29:11countries that are together. In my opinion,

00:29:14and you may disagree with me on this, and that's fine, but

00:29:18The only way out of that is to disentangle those countries

00:29:22and dissolve the EU or at least

00:29:25Countries start pulling out of that like Britain did

00:29:29because

00:29:30they'll never get

00:29:32consensus

00:29:33in an EU that It's

00:29:35beneficial

00:29:37for the average person. They will just continue to enrich themselves. Now that's my opinion, and I

00:29:44I even hope I'm wrong because

00:29:47I don't see countries pulling out of the EU.

00:29:49Although, like I said, Britain did, but, Yeah. I mean, we've got these situations developing in one way or the other all over the world. Not to spend too much time talking about this, but

00:29:59This is kind of the point of all of this stuff that's going on. Fiat is dying.

00:30:04Countries

00:30:05are exploding in debt. How are they gonna deal with it?

McIntosh:00:30:09Argentina, 144%.

McIntosh:00:30:12What Milei ran on is he's gonna go in there and gut the government.

00:30:16He's going to go in there and

00:30:19Dollarized country.

00:30:21He's going to open up the markets. He's gonna stop blaming

00:30:24businesses for their problems, which I think is a very interesting idea. I didn't realize it was like that

00:30:32with the

00:30:33who were the people who were in power previously.

00:30:38But on the other hand,

00:30:40individual actions do solve problems.

00:30:42And in countries

00:30:44Like the United States

00:30:46that are stuck in a 2 party quagmire

00:30:50where real change is not gonna take place anytime soon in my opinion.

00:30:54Yes. Individual actions will speak louder than

00:30:58anything else. And that's why I'm willing to say things like, well, if you're going to force me to

00:31:03Since their Bitcoin transactions, I'll move my servers somewhere else even though that may cost me money and time and stress.

McIntosh:00:31:11Absolutely.

McIntosh:00:31:13That's why I'm willing to say things like,

00:31:16even

00:31:17PayPal.

00:31:18Just as simple as that. I don't take PayPal. I used to.

00:31:21And they were

00:31:23rejecting someone's business,

00:31:26or shut down their account. I don't remember the details. They've done it a number of times over the years. And the last time I heard about it, I'm just like, I'm fed up. I'm shutting down my account. I will no longer use them, and I no longer accept

00:31:38Fiat through PayPal even though that's the easiest way in the world to have it on your website.

00:31:44That cost me.

00:31:46These things are important, and I I appreciate that. I know you were not

00:31:51being serious, actually, just as another note.

00:31:55Yeah. I got it. It just I don't know.

00:31:59It's the way I get roll, man. Just I don't know.

00:32:04I I felt

00:32:06I when I recorded that, I'm like, man, should I put that in? I almost didn't.

00:32:10I almost just kinda just let it go. It's not directly relevant to this Bitcoin content, and I I don't know. I just,

00:32:20it's just

00:32:21I chose to leave it in because sometimes I do try and kind

00:32:25of help y'all to understand where I'm coming from. So alright. Enough about that, but thank you. Thank you both for your support.

00:32:32Alright. Let's jump into the news. I need to get this wrapped up because I gotta get cleaned up to go to the family.

00:32:39So

00:32:39I thought we've already covered kind of the big news item of the week, at least in my opinion. Now a lot of people didn't talk about it, and that's

00:32:47okay.

00:32:48So, right, they're blaming Binance. I will say this about this whole Binance. They're using that to funnel money to Hamas and blah blah blah.

00:32:57I I don't know.

McIntosh:00:32:58I don't know.

00:33:00It's a mess.

McIntosh:00:33:01I think, like I said about Argentina, they're making it very clear they're going to be moving very quickly to the dollar. They're going to kill their central bank.

00:33:12It may be gone before the end of the year.

McIntosh:00:33:15That may have actually been it.

00:33:18Looks like it. I mean, I did only record a few days ago, but

00:33:22I did wanna draw this out.

McIntosh:00:33:26Alex Gladstein,

00:33:27he wrote oh, what's that book? I've talked about it.

00:33:32He writes about the IMF World Bank.

00:33:34He writes about,

00:33:36oh, human rights a lot. He's the

00:33:38founder of the Human Rights Foundation, I think it's called. The Oslo Forum.

McIntosh:00:33:43Anyways,

McIntosh:00:33:45this was posted about a interview that he did with Peter McCormick recently,

00:33:49I think.

00:33:51It's Peter McCormick here. In 1970,

McIntosh:00:33:54total debt owed by poor countries, and I don't know what poor countries means, but,

00:34:00whatever, was $46,000,000,000.

McIntosh:00:34:03Today, they owe $8,700,000,000,000.

00:34:06That's a 189

00:34:08x.

00:34:10So times increase in 5 decades. For every

00:34:14$1 of aid

00:34:16that developing countries receive, they lose $24

00:34:19in that

00:34:20outflow.

00:34:21Argentina

00:34:22is opting out of IMF and World Bank debt slavery. I Believe that last statement is absolutely correct.

00:34:28I believe that is something that,

00:34:31Milei has already,

00:34:34Indicated,

00:34:36that the

00:34:37talks that they were already having with the IMF or and and the World Bank are are out the window. They're not doing that. So

00:34:44glad to hear that.

00:34:47Congratulations,

00:34:48Argentina, for taking that very

00:34:50Important step towards

00:34:53national sovereignty, which is what they need.

00:34:56These countries that owe the IMF, the World Bank, You know, they they are not sovereign. They are they are in debt. Put it crudely, they are slaves to the IMF and World Bank, and I'd I'd

00:35:07so not a whole lot of news.

00:35:09No news about these ETFs other than

00:35:13I don't know who somebody

00:35:15updating their paperwork. I mean, we're literally to that point where people, oh, they updated their paperwork.

00:35:22It will happen. It will probably be Q1. I don't think it will happen this year, but yeah.

00:35:29Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2.0. It's a value for value podcast With no sponsors

00:35:34and no advertising, you can support the podcast in 3 different ways, time, talent, treasure. If you wanna support the podcast that has some time or talent, Hey. While I'm taking this break in December, I could use some extra help with lots of things. So just reach out, mccintosh@gendashbtc.com

00:35:51to, let me know. I could use help with things like transcripts,

00:35:55website move, other things, treasure is just what it sounds like. If you find the content valuable,

00:36:01you can support the podcast by streaming sets or boosting like our supporters did today from a podcasting 2.0 app. You can get the podcasting tool point o apps

00:36:12if you do not already have one

00:36:14from new podcast apps dotcom. I like fountain. I like podcast guru.

00:36:22Those are the ones that I have tried.

00:36:25Podverse,

00:36:25not Castamatic.

00:36:27Sorry.

00:36:28Fountain Podcast Guru and Podverse are the ones that I have done oh, I do have Castamatic, and I have used

00:36:36those are the four that I've used, and they've all been pleasant. You just need to figure out which one you like, so go try them.

00:36:42Connect one of those up to maybe an Albie wallet, for example, or your lightning wallet,

00:36:47and then you can then stream and boost,

00:36:50the podcast that you're listening to,

00:36:53you know, we call this value for value. If we're providing value to you, then You can provide value back and help support this show.

00:37:02And there's so many ways of doing it beyond just

00:37:05the sats. Right?

00:37:07As an example, if you like the content, I would love it if you tell your friends about Generation Bitcoin. That is one of the best ways to keep our numbers growing

00:37:16and moving in an upward direction. Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful. I would love to hear from you. I'm on Twitter at McintoshFintech.
