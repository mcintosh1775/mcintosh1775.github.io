In Episode 242 of Satoshi’s Plebs, McIntosh and Kenshin talk through how Bitcoin serves the unbanked—people with little or no access to traditional banking due to geography, documentation, KYC/AML barriers, profit-driven gatekeeping, political targeting, and capital controls. They frame Bitcoin’s core advantage as permissionless access: it doesn’t care who you are or where you live—only whether you control your keys.

They keep it honest by covering the hurdles too: education, infrastructure, custody risks, and volatility. The episode closes with a dignity-focused point: giving someone in a remote village the ability to securely save and transact can change their long-term outlook and put them on a more level playing field globally.
