In this episode, Mcintosh and Kenshin discuss the IMF's influence over El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption, exploring how international financial institutions exert control over sovereign nations through monetary policy. The conversation expands to examine France's ongoing monetary colonialism in Africa through the CFA franc system, and how organizations like the IMF enable economic control over developing nations. The hosts also debate different forms of governance, from monarchies to democracies, and their long-term impacts on nations and families. Along the way, they cover personal updates including Kenshin's unexpected ban from Claude AI, mining developments in China, Japan's massive stimulus budget, and various Bitcoin ecosystem updates.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V tracks by The Top Hat Orchestra "Let It Snow" and "Hot Chocolate".
