One ecosystem and token I haven't discussed very much is XRP. The XRP token hasn't had a lot going on the last several years because of the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. That lawsuit is (hopefully) going to be resolved soon. What will that mean for XRP? Does it have a future? And should you invest in ripple? Join us and find out what's going on with XRP.

I can be reached by email at [mcintosh@satoshis-plebs.com ](mailto:mcintosh@satoshis-plebs.com)and on twitter at @McIntoshFinTech. Looking forward to hearing from you!
