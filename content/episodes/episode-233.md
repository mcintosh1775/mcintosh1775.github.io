In this episode, McIntosh and Kenshin dive into the current Bitcoin market conditions and whether we're heading into a bear market. With Bitcoin hovering around $83,000—down roughly 34% from its all-time high—the hosts debate what historical patterns suggest versus what unique factors might be at play this cycle. They discuss the impact of ETF selling pressure (including BlackRock's record outflows), institutional buying from El Salvador and MicroStrategy, and the macroeconomic forces that could shape Bitcoin's trajectory in the coming months.
The conversation touches on potential U.S. monetary policy shifts, the effectiveness of recent economic measures, and why the hosts believe DCA remains the smartest strategy regardless of short-term price action. Whether you're nervous about the dip or seeing it as a buying opportunity, this episode offers perspective on staying grounded during volatile times

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “The Jetsons” by Joe Martin.
