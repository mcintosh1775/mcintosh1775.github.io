In this week's episode, McIntosh and Kenshin answer listener questions from Nostr, covering topics ranging from European Bitcoin adoption to the future of decentralized social media. The hosts discuss where European Bitcoiners might consider relocating as regulations tighten, with Switzerland emerging as a top choice despite its costs. They tackle questions about Bitcoin's role as money versus store of value, Nostr's current challenges with relay infrastructure and growth, and whether CBDCs pose any real threat to Bitcoin. The conversation also touches on Strike's new Bitcoin-backed loans in Europe, the latest Sparrow wallet update with silent payment support, and predictions for Bitcoin adoption over the next decade.

Stick around to the very end for Send It Mike's  track, “Freedom Code Revolution”.
