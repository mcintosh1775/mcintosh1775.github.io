[00:00:01] Welcome back to Satoshi's Plebs for episode two forty two. I'm Macintosh.

[00:00:05] I'm Kenshin. And in today's episode, we are talking about how Bitcoin helps the unbanked.

[00:00:18] And ladies and gentlemen

[00:00:24] oh my goodness.

[00:00:26] Awesome.

[00:00:28] That is some fine technical production there.

[00:00:32] What was there a delay there or what? This is how you know we're amateurs.

[00:00:37] Oh

[00:00:39] my goodness.

[00:00:40] Alright, Kenshin.

[00:00:42] With that introduction,

[00:00:45] what's going on with you, sir, this fine week?

[00:00:49] We'll get that out of the way.

[00:00:51] It's cold in Sweden, but I I bet it's cold there also. Right?

[00:00:57] It is. Not as cold as you are.

[00:01:01] We got down to and I I only know this in Fahrenheit.

[00:01:06] I'm sorry. But Okay. Twenty

[00:01:09] twenty eight,

[00:01:11] twenty seven

[00:01:12] last night, and then actually late this week, I think Sunday, it's supposed to get down to, like, twenty two.

[00:01:19] So Oh, okay. Like

[00:01:22] well, it's like 10 degrees less than

[00:01:25] freezing, zero.

[00:01:27] So I don't I don't know. It'd be negative

[00:01:30] two or three or something. I don't know. Negative

[00:01:33] five

[00:01:34] Swedish.

[00:01:35] Okay.

[00:01:36] So not as cold because you already told me how cold it was there, and I need to turn the fan off. It was, like, minus 12 when I was on the way home out in the countryside.

[00:01:47] And here outside of, I think, our house is, like, minus 10.

[00:01:52] So, yeah, quite cold. And,

[00:01:56] yeah, it's at least the days are getting longer, so we're getting this out of the way,

[00:02:02] which

[00:02:03] is a big deal here. So it only gets dark at 04:30PM

[00:02:08] now, so that's not so bad compared to 03:00 before.

[00:02:13] So I'm gonna go ahead. We've got everything booked and whatever.

[00:02:17] I'm gonna tell you this. I I don't think I've told you this.

[00:02:22] Our family,

[00:02:24] a good portion of our family is actually going on a trip

[00:02:28] Okay. In June

[00:02:30] to go to Fairbanks,

[00:02:32] Alaska.

[00:02:33] Do you know where that is? You know where Alaska is. Right? Yeah. I heard of it. Yeah. So Fairbanks is right in the middle of the state.

[00:02:41] Oh, wow. And When when is that?

[00:02:46] June?

[00:02:48] Think we leave, like, the twenty third.

[00:02:51] The interesting thing what brings this up though,

[00:02:54] it's summer solstice, like, June 21 or something.

[00:02:58] And they have a celebration,

[00:03:00] which we won't be there for, but, you know,

[00:03:03] basically,

[00:03:05] it's it's light all day. It's the opposite of what it is during the winter. Right? It's light all day long.

[00:03:13] So I'm looking forward to that. But yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean to get sidetracked. It's just when you were talking about the sun. It's just

[00:03:20] Yeah. Whatever.

[00:03:22] Anyway. Yeah. But it in general here, it's always the topic. You start all the meetings around here in Sweden. It's always talking about the weather.

[00:03:30] It's cold. It's snowy. It's dark. Or

[00:03:34] It's like that. Do

[00:03:37] y'all deal with more depression

[00:03:40] during the winter when it's dark all the time like that? Yeah. For sure. Yeah. And Sweden is one of the highest places with

[00:03:48] depression and suicide,

[00:03:50] surprisingly. Really?

[00:03:52] Yeah.

[00:03:54] Nordic countries I think. Yeah.

[00:03:56] But I thought Denmark was the happiest place on earth. Right? Is it Denmark?

[00:04:01] Yeah.

[00:04:02] Maybe that's The Netherlands.

[00:04:04] Don't know. Could be all the stuff. Yeah. They

[00:04:08] Yeah.

[00:04:09] They they say the quality of life

[00:04:11] is also one of the best and whatever but Right.

[00:04:16] But you struggle

[00:04:18] think it has to do with the the darkness during winter? I

[00:04:22] think two two things.

[00:04:24] Darkness for sure

[00:04:25] Mhmm.

[00:04:27] And lack of sun because even in the summer you have a lot of clouds and rainy days.

[00:04:32] Mhmm. I remember when I was in another city, South Of Sweden,

[00:04:37] and Mhmm.

[00:04:39] One day was sunny.

[00:04:41] And I looked down and I saw my shadow, and I thought, wow. Okay.

[00:04:46] There's my shadow again.

[00:04:48] Yeah. It does realize on that moment, hadn't seen my shadow for, like, two weeks or something.

[00:04:54] So,

[00:04:55] yeah, sun is a big thing. And I realized it also when I came to Sweden first six months. I realized, wow, I miss the sun. I never thought about the sun in that way, that I miss the sun because, of course, I come from Greece and we have sun Right. Most of the year You're in the Mediterranean.

[00:05:10] Yeah.

[00:05:12] So that's a big big thing.

[00:05:15] Another thing is that

[00:05:18] it's

[00:05:19] very

[00:05:20] easy

[00:05:21] life, would say. Mhmm.

[00:05:23] In terms of you don't worry too much

[00:05:27] And I I find it that when you don't worry,

[00:05:31] it's how do we say?

[00:05:35] You don't activate the brain and the body in the same way as when you have things to fight for in life, you know? You get too complacent and then you get lazy and then you get depressed. You

[00:05:47] don't have a motivation

[00:05:49] in life Right. If I say in a better way.

[00:05:52] I saying that clearly Sweden is too easy.

[00:05:56] Actually, yeah. It is too easy.

[00:05:59] And and I saw that even more stark difference when I went to Brazil

[00:06:03] for one summer vacation.

[00:06:06] And it I real it really felt like Brazilians were the the poorest

[00:06:12] people I ever met, the poorest people Right. But at the same time, the happiest people I've ever met.

[00:06:18] And that's conflict,

[00:06:20] know.

[00:06:20] Yeah. It's weird. Was difficult to understand.

[00:06:23] What's the word? It's a weird paradigm. And paradigm's

[00:06:26] not the right word but Yeah. Yeah, it is weird. I have been out in the countryside in China

[00:06:32] where

[00:06:35] I remember

[00:06:36] and this has been a number of years ago, in fact it's been two over two decades ago.

[00:06:41] But

[00:06:42] we went to visit some people

[00:06:45] and they had built a block house, concrete block, okay,

[00:06:50] with concrete floor,

[00:06:52] which was a big upgrade for them.

[00:06:54] But there was one one

[00:06:57] light bulb in the entire house.

[00:07:00] Okay. And it wasn't a big house, but literally that was There was just one

[00:07:04] that was the sum total of the electric

[00:07:08] electricity,

[00:07:09] you know, in the in the place.

[00:07:12] But my point is extremely poor people,

[00:07:16] but yes,

[00:07:18] very,

[00:07:19] very happy. I I and it's weird because these

[00:07:22] people are

[00:07:25] basically fighting to survive,

[00:07:27] but at the same time, they're they're just happy. I don't I don't I can't I don't have an answer for that. I just I agree completely with what you're saying though.

[00:07:36] Yeah. And I remember one other big aspect that

[00:07:39] kind of combines to all of this is the very Sweden is one of the most individualistic

[00:07:45] societies.

[00:07:46] So everybody

[00:07:48] has an apartment,

[00:07:50] you could say, you know, and and they live alone and they go to work and then home and then back to work. You know, they don't live together, big families with a grandfather and the grandmother and,

[00:08:01] you know. When

[00:08:03] you are 18, you go out of the house.

[00:08:05] Even if you're in the same city, you go to the student apartment.

[00:08:10] Right.

[00:08:11] How is it called? So So you're instantly away from the family and you There's a lack of community.

[00:08:18] Right? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Unfortunately.

[00:08:21] Interesting.

[00:08:23] Alright. What else?

[00:08:26] Yeah.

[00:08:27] Well, talking about family, yeah, my mother is visiting for a she will stay maybe a month.

[00:08:33] Awesome. Yeah.

[00:08:36] Will stay until

[00:08:39] actually,

[00:08:40] no.

[00:08:41] She flew first to

[00:08:44] where did she go?

[00:08:46] She went to France.

[00:08:48] Oh. I think she went to France first. Yeah. She went to France to a couple of places, then to Italy. And from Italy she came here. Oh, she's just traveling around. Go go go mom.

[00:09:00] That's awesome.

[00:09:02] And then she wants to buy

[00:09:04] yeah. She wants to buy here a campervan. How do you call it? Oh. You know the camper van that you live inside?

[00:09:12] That's funny.

[00:09:13] So she's gonna drive around.

[00:09:15] Yeah. And then she wants to drive back to Greece and then to the whole of Europe after that.

[00:09:21] I'm jealous.

[00:09:23] Yeah.

[00:09:24] That would be awesome. Good thing about being a pensioner.

[00:09:28] I would love to to drive through the Alps,

[00:09:31] especially. Yeah. My wife gets carsick,

[00:09:34] but I I I so

[00:09:38] there's a problem there but I love driving through the mountains like that.

[00:09:43] Right. Maybe it's your driving style.

[00:09:50] No. It's not.

[00:09:52] I'm super careful.

[00:09:54] We were just up in North Carolina,

[00:09:56] know.

[00:09:57] And it's certainly not the Alps but you know there's

[00:10:01] a lot of curves and whatever and I am I'm very careful. I I drive really slow actually. I probably

[00:10:08] I know I annoy people up there that live there because I don't

[00:10:13] unless I'm by myself, I don't drive

[00:10:16] very fast Mhmm. Because of that.

[00:10:19] And in fact, like we'll be going up a mountain

[00:10:23] and

[00:10:25] I'll start getting two, three cars behind me and I'll look for a place to pull off because I just I don't wanna block people. I don't wanna be that kind of person. Right. You know? And so we pull off and let them you know, we just take our time. I don't know. It's whatever.

[00:10:39] Okay. So I wouldn't like to drive behind you then?

[00:10:43] Probably not. Probably not. So I do need to ask,

[00:10:48] how's this project going?

[00:10:53] Really

[00:10:55] close. Right?

[00:10:57] Never been closer.

[00:10:59] Is this like is this like mining a block? Is this what it is? That's Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's it's it's a difficulty has a it's adjusting.

[00:11:08] It's adjusting.

[00:11:11] Oh, man.

[00:11:12] Well, you're making Yeah.

[00:11:15] And, you know, I I started

[00:11:17] since a month ago tracking all the issues on GitHub.

[00:11:21] Mhmm. So now is the first time that I don't have a big issue on GitHub. I look at all the issues and I'm thinking,

[00:11:28] okay.

[00:11:28] Is not crucial for launch. Right. This is not. This is not.

[00:11:33] Do you have an MVP?

[00:11:34] Do you know what that means? A minimal viable product? Viable product. Yeah.

[00:11:39] You could call it deaf, more than MVP right now. There you go.

[00:11:45] I

[00:11:45] yeah. I think

[00:11:47] I would give it an extra week because actually we want to,

[00:11:53] how do you say, put data into the site. It's a site that has Mhmm. Data points. Right? I want to put data points before going live so people have stuff to look

[00:12:05] data to look and not be empty. So I would give it an extra week just for that.

[00:12:11] But I think the main stuff are done and then just to write some press release, some social media posts.

[00:12:19] Get her done.

[00:12:21] That's Larry, the cable guy.

[00:12:23] I know you don't know who that is but

[00:12:26] that's I think I heard of it. He's a redneck that's why I identify

[00:12:31] with him.

[00:12:32] Do

[00:12:33] you know what a redneck is?

[00:12:35] I heard of it. Yeah. It's a southern person.

[00:12:39] A southern person.

[00:12:40] Actually

[00:12:42] comes from

[00:12:43] in the old days the people of course were they the majority were farmers they'd be out in the field

[00:12:50] and in the Southeast

[00:12:53] Of The United States. It's humid, it's hot, it's

[00:12:57] the sun is out,

[00:12:58] you know, a lot unlike in Sweden

[00:13:01] apparently.

[00:13:03] And people would get burned like on the back of their neck.

[00:13:07] So they called them rednecks. That's literally where that comes from.

[00:13:11] Anyways. Yeah.

[00:13:15] Cool.

[00:13:16] Alright. You

[00:13:17] have some news. I

[00:13:20] got a few things going on. What was I gonna tell you? I said I was gonna wait.

[00:13:24] Something with the Internet. Mediacom. Yeah. So as everyone on this podcast

[00:13:30] knows,

[00:13:30] sadly,

[00:13:32] I have a lot of Internet trouble. In fact, I'm running on my phone today

[00:13:37] because our Internet is out. But the reason why it is actually out,

[00:13:42] Mediacom came out yesterday

[00:13:45] because our Internet started going out again. They came out. The guy looked over everything, and he says, oh, we need to replace your line from the road to the house because

[00:13:57] the squirrels have been eating it.

[00:14:02] I am like, are you kidding me? Apparently,

[00:14:05] they get up there and they chew on the lines

[00:14:08] and

[00:14:09] they

[00:14:11] it's just what they do. I mean, they're squirrels. They're just stupid little animals and they don't know any better.

[00:14:17] But the line is old enough that they've literally chewed through a lot of the casing and it's exposed it to the elements and whatever.

[00:14:27] And so

[00:14:28] they're go ahead.

[00:14:30] What what type of cable is that? I mean, is is it It's a it comes on the air, the cable, and then Well say it's

[00:14:38] a phone cable, old school phone cables or what? It's a I'm not sure.

[00:14:43] It it normally would be a coaxial cable.

[00:14:47] So this is a cable company like what we used to get our cable TV with. Now everything's over the Internet, but, you know,

[00:14:56] I'm not even a 100% sure that's what that is,

[00:15:00] but they have a box right across the road from us

[00:15:04] that's like a a patch

[00:15:06] center for the area. And so they're gonna run a new line up across the road because we do live on a fairly busy road

[00:15:14] and then down.

[00:15:16] And then, actually,

[00:15:18] not down.

[00:15:19] It's through the air over to our house, and then

[00:15:23] that'll come in to the box that's on the side of our house. They've already rebuilt the line from the box

[00:15:30] going

[00:15:31] from that box to our modem.

[00:15:34] So, essentially, when they get done, we will have brand new

[00:15:39] equipment all the way from our modem all the way out to the switch box.

[00:15:46] So I actually think this is gonna make a significant difference. I'm very hopeful. We'll see. Yeah. My wife said earlier that the internet was back on, we switched it over and it didn't really work very well so

[00:15:59] maybe they're still tweaking it but

[00:16:02] I hope so. I'm so tired of this

[00:16:05] And we pay a decent amount of money and it's supposed to be like half a gigabit, like 500 megabits down and like a 100 megabits up. If

[00:16:15] everything is okay, we do get that kind of speed

[00:16:19] But Yeah. There's so many times when it just go kinda goes in and out and it's really annoying.

[00:16:25] So we got that going on. I did wanna say one more thing and I know we've kinda talked a lot about our personal stuff but

[00:16:32] I have to tell you this. We don't talk a whole lot when we're not we just don't have time, neither one of us. And our hours are almost exactly opposite of each other, which doesn't really help. You get up, it's like 02:00 in the morning here.

[00:16:49] It's like when you're going off to work. So a lot of times there's actually a little bit of overlap there because I still love like last messages.

[00:16:58] Right. I start message. Oh, I'm like, he's awake. Okay. Start sending me messages.

[00:17:05] I even told you last night, was off to bed as I put the outline up for the podcast and I said I'm taking melatonin and going to bed because I needed to get a few hours of sleep.

[00:17:17] So,

[00:17:17] anyways,

[00:17:18] I did a thing this week. I I I

[00:17:22] forgive me if I've already told you about this, but I started a project for my wife a couple weeks ago.

[00:17:28] And I didn't it doesn't matter. It's AI based and

[00:17:33] we're pulling in transcripts and building a knowledge base essentially.

[00:17:37] I'm training

[00:17:38] an AI system is really what I'm doing. So it's called RAG and I do not know what that stands for, but you can look it up like AI RAG

[00:17:48] and you can find it. It's basically a way of building a specialized system.

[00:17:53] So when I query it, it literally looks at these this data I'm pulling into the database

[00:17:59] and then uses that as part of the information

[00:18:02] that it goes out to ChatGPT

[00:18:04] to return the the real query. ChatGPT

[00:18:07] is still doing the majority of the lifting, but I've I've got this pool of information over here that it

[00:18:14] it makes it smarter.

[00:18:16] Okay?

[00:18:17] Okay. It uses what's called a vector database,

[00:18:20] which is just a specialized database

[00:18:23] specifically

[00:18:24] for these systems.

[00:18:27] I'm so happy, Kenshin. It took me about a day, a day and a half, and I had

[00:18:34] I don't have that MVP.

[00:18:35] Actually, I do. I would say I do have an MVP.

[00:18:38] I literally have a little product that I can go in there and query

[00:18:42] chat GPT

[00:18:43] and it pulls it and it I mean, it's good information. It's what I would expect to come out of it.

[00:18:50] It's crazy. All's I gotta do now, I'm gonna do a couple more things. I've got more data. I've only transcribed like

[00:18:58] five hours of data and I have a decent amount more to pull in. And then I'm gonna build a little web interface so she doesn't have to query it from the command line. So there'll be a little web server, she'll query it and

[00:19:10] and it'll go do its thing and return its results.

[00:19:14] And

[00:19:15] Cool. I'll be the hero and it'll be awesome. No. I'm just kidding.

[00:19:20] I it's been really cool though. I really it's been neat diving into this. And I honestly, it's it might even be something I'm well,

[00:19:28] it's really cool.

[00:19:30] Yeah. It's really neat.

[00:19:32] Amazing what you can do nowadays, all those dashboards

[00:19:35] and It's incredible. Yeah.

[00:19:37] It is in I

[00:19:40] am

[00:19:41] sorry.

[00:19:43] I am so excited about what's coming. I I may get fired from my job.

[00:19:49] I mean, it's a possibility.

[00:19:51] It it's terrible economy,

[00:19:53] whatever.

[00:19:54] But as an entrepreneur,

[00:19:56] which really deep down I am,

[00:19:59] I have never been so excited about the ability to create things. It's just it's just,

[00:20:05] bah. It's like Yeah. Oh, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do this and I'm you know, something eventually has to work. Right? Yeah. So Yeah. I had also this epiphany like a few weeks ago. I was thinking we will we will be 10 in ten years time, look back

[00:20:21] and think, wow. At that time,

[00:20:24] we could you know, it's like the the the start of the .com era. Right. You could buy any website

[00:20:30] and you're in that phase and you look back now and it's like, oh, those guys could actually make cat.com

[00:20:36] or whatever. Exactly.

[00:20:38] We are at this phase now. It's like, you have an idea Exactly where we're at. You're Yeah. You don't need a 10 people programmer team

[00:20:46] and millions of of investment to start a project. You you can't just,

[00:20:51] yeah, start it yourself. It's incredible.

[00:20:55] Okay. Look. We're twenty eight minutes into this. I

[00:20:59] don't know exactly when we started, but we're a ways into this. We need to get moving along.

[00:21:05] Yeah.

[00:21:06] The Kenshin and Macintosh

[00:21:08] discussion

[00:21:09] hour. I don't know.

[00:21:11] Block height as we go is nine three four one one five.

[00:21:15] Okay? So I we're gonna talk about that a little bit more later.

[00:21:20] Things are

[00:21:21] are slow Slow and dime. On the Bitcoin network right now. And I love it, but we'll get to that later. What's today's topic, sir?

[00:21:30] Well, today's topic is

[00:21:32] how Bitcoin

[00:21:34] fits in the unbanked

[00:21:36] world. Okay. And a bit yeah. The purpose it can fulfill, and it's it was designed also to fulfill.

[00:21:44] Right.

[00:21:46] Yeah. I do believe this was

[00:21:48] maybe not initially. Maybe he wasn't directly thinking about this, but I think early on this became very important.

[00:21:57] Mhmm. So

[00:21:58] dealing with Bitcoin, dealing with reaching,

[00:22:02] for lack of a better word, the unbanked. And what we mean simply by unbanked is people who they don't have access to

[00:22:10] a banking system. Banking system, yeah. Maybe it's because of where they live, maybe it's because of who they are and we'll talk about that a little bit more. But I'm banked, I mean I have two different banks that I work with, I don't know, I assume you work with at least one,

[00:22:28] right Kenja?

[00:22:29] And most people in the Western world are but there's so many people

[00:22:34] that aren't. So when when we talk about banking, we're talking about

[00:22:40] things that in general, although I feel like things are maybe not doing so good these days, but they're easy, they're convenient.

[00:22:48] Things like Mhmm. Apps on your phone, things like credit cards. Right? Things like

[00:22:54] instant transfers.

[00:22:55] They may ask you a bunch of questions, but the transfer doesn't take that long in direct deposit. I mean, my paycheck,

[00:23:02] I

[00:23:03] I used to get a paper paycheck, I haven't done that in years,

[00:23:07] you know? And you'd get the paper paycheck, you'd take it down to the bank, you'd put it in. Now it just shows up in my account. I mean that's just another example

[00:23:15] of convenience.

[00:23:17] But unfortunately,

[00:23:22] there are over a billion people, about 1,400,000,000

[00:23:25] people worldwide that not only is it inconvenient,

[00:23:31] they just don't have banks. They they they have no access

[00:23:36] to that.

[00:23:37] Mhmm. And then there's

[00:23:39] probably a couple billion more who

[00:23:42] it's very very difficult for them.

[00:23:44] Yeah. It's like two to 3,000,000,000 more

[00:23:47] Yeah. Barely works. They don't have savings.

[00:23:50] They don't have ways of moving money that

[00:23:53] work very well. There's no protection from inflation,

[00:23:57] from corruption.

[00:23:59] And these are themes,

[00:24:01] if you wanna call it that, I think that very conveniently,

[00:24:04] very easily,

[00:24:06] they mesh

[00:24:08] with Bitcoin.

[00:24:09] It's the things that we talk about.

[00:24:12] These people don't have to wait

[00:24:15] for Bank of America to open up a

[00:24:18] branch.

[00:24:21] They can

[00:24:22] run their own node

[00:24:24] and manage their own Bitcoin

[00:24:26] whether that's by Lightning or on the main network.

[00:24:30] We

[00:24:32] talk about a lot of things in Bitcoin. We talk about prices,

[00:24:36] know, and I think honestly sometimes we're probably

[00:24:39] a little too much on talking about price.

[00:24:44] It's very difficult not to, but, we talk about price. We talk about where it's going. We talk about all

[00:24:51] the other things

[00:24:53] in the world about banking and whatever, but in the end, Bitcoin is really

[00:24:59] one of its fundamental features. I'm not gonna say the only thing, but one of its fundamental features

[00:25:05] is simply access.

[00:25:07] Bitcoin doesn't care

[00:25:09] where you live.

[00:25:11] Bitcoin doesn't care

[00:25:13] your privilege level,

[00:25:15] so to speak. Bitcoin doesn't care how much money you have in the bank.

[00:25:20] If you have a job or not. Yeah. Bitcoin is for and and it doesn't care what the government thinks, frankly.

[00:25:27] Okay? Right.

[00:25:29] But

[00:25:31] because of all that,

[00:25:33] I would make the argument that Bitcoin is for the unbanked, and I think it's the best option out there.

[00:25:41] Does that make sense?

[00:25:43] Yeah.

[00:25:44] So we've got all these people,

[00:25:47] right? They don't have a bank account, they don't have credit.

[00:25:51] It's funny, my wife and I were talking about our credit rating the other day. They don't have a credit rating. They don't have a line of credit at the bank.

[00:25:59] They have nothing like that. They don't have savings. They don't

[00:26:03] have any kind of identity

[00:26:05] in the financial world.

[00:26:07] And maybe their country,

[00:26:10] maybe it's the Argentine peso,

[00:26:13] not stable. Still

[00:26:15] better but maybe not as stable as it hopefully will be down the road.

[00:26:20] Right?

[00:26:22] And they don't have any kind of access to a global financial system except through Bitcoin.

[00:26:28] Right?

[00:26:30] And another

[00:26:31] thing, some of them might not even have Internet

[00:26:34] because Bitcoin

[00:26:36] there are some systems in Africa, right, that you can use Bitcoin with SMS? That is correct. You technically

[00:26:42] and I don't know how usable it is.

[00:26:45] I would not wanna depend on it,

[00:26:48] shall we say.

[00:26:49] But

[00:26:50] there's a system that

[00:26:53] that doesn't yeah. It it's it literally does not connect to the Internet except at the very end.

[00:27:02] So

[00:27:03] it is possible even in that case. One nice thing,

[00:27:08] places like Africa,

[00:27:10] developing

[00:27:10] areas, if you wanna call it that,

[00:27:13] unlike The United States,

[00:27:15] they're not stringing a bunch of phone lines everywhere and, you know, we gotta run this kind of

[00:27:21] they're using wireless,

[00:27:23] whether that's your data phone, you know, your your phone, or whether that's,

[00:27:28] like,

[00:27:29] satellite Internet or or whatever,

[00:27:32] and they're actually able to build out that infrastructure much faster.

[00:27:37] It took us decades in The United States

[00:27:40] to build a

[00:27:41] semi reasonable

[00:27:44] Internet infrastructure.

[00:27:46] But now you could put up a tower and cover a gigantic area,

[00:27:51] and give access to whoever lives in that area.

[00:27:54] Does that make sense?

[00:27:56] So Yep. We will see that Internet

[00:27:59] adoption

[00:28:00] accelerate

[00:28:01] in places like Africa,

[00:28:03] where frankly they need it the most.

[00:28:06] One of the things I wanna touch on real quick is why

[00:28:10] these people get excluded. Why are the unbanked left out? It's

[00:28:16] can be a number of reasons.

[00:28:19] They may not they may not have

[00:28:24] well, I'll I'll add one to this list. I have a list here, and there's one that's not even on here.

[00:28:29] They may not live anywhere where there's a bank.

[00:28:32] I mean, somebody in

[00:28:34] Africa

[00:28:36] I'm trying to give a good example.

[00:28:38] I'm not thinking off the top of my head.

[00:28:41] But let's say they live whatever nation they live in, they may live 500 or a thousand miles from their capital city,

[00:28:49] and that capital city is the only place where there are banks. They don't have regional banks out in a village of a thousand people in rural

[00:28:58] Africa.

[00:28:59] I'm sorry. They don't.

[00:29:01] So they may not just even be able to get to the bank.

[00:29:06] So that's one problem.

[00:29:09] They may have a documentation

[00:29:10] problem. They may not be able to prove that they are who they say they are. And when you walk into a bank to open up an account,

[00:29:18] they're gonna want two forms of ID and a note from your village elder, you know.

[00:29:25] That

[00:29:26] also

[00:29:27] excludes a lot of people.

[00:29:29] These days, we've got KYC and AML

[00:29:32] measures,

[00:29:33] and it's not just in The United States. We're the ones who

[00:29:38] sadly pioneered

[00:29:39] this.

[00:29:41] But

[00:29:42] because

[00:29:44] you could make the argument that The US is the world leader in finance,

[00:29:49] basically,

[00:29:50] country in the world who's

[00:29:52] deeply involved in in finance and whatever, they have taken over these standards for their own.

[00:29:59] Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Well,

[00:30:03] I am I have been a personally declined banking services

[00:30:08] Okay.

[00:30:09] Here in Europe from

[00:30:11] a neo bank. You you know what a neo bank is?

[00:30:15] The term? Like like an online bank only? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Those modern online banks. Right.

[00:30:21] So one fancy one that says, yeah. You know? We're the best and more modern and this and that. And Mhmm.

[00:30:29] And I thought

[00:30:31] because they they ask all those KYC AML questions.

[00:30:34] Mhmm. And

[00:30:36] some of the questions were, are you gonna send money outside of your country, basically,

[00:30:42] to other countries in Europe?

[00:30:44] And I'm like, what should I say? And I said, yes. I answered yes because I thought, okay. Maybe I will. Maybe I will use one of those

[00:30:53] services in Switzerland where you do some

[00:30:56] exchange from Bitcoin from euros to Bitcoin. Right? Right.

[00:31:00] So I thought, okay. I don't want to open an account and then send some money and they block it. You know? So I'm like, okay. I will be super honest

[00:31:07] and see what happens. So I said, yes. I will. And, of course, the next question is, what why? What's the reason?

[00:31:16] And I wrote, oh, I'm gonna do some exchanges with Bitcoin.

[00:31:21] And

[00:31:23] I wrote Bitcoin.

[00:31:26] So

[00:31:26] I submitted all this,

[00:31:28] and I was declined.

[00:31:30] Right. And and I asked why,

[00:31:35] and they didn't say why. They said I I don't remember what they said. Oh, and then I applied again

[00:31:41] a few weeks

[00:31:42] or months later,

[00:31:44] and I didn't mention Bitcoin.

[00:31:47] And I I was declined again, and then a per person from the KYC

[00:31:52] officer or whatever said Mhmm. Why

[00:31:55] before you said you would do some exchanges with Bitcoin and now you didn't mention that. I said, well, because now I have a much better service to do that I don't need you guys for Right. That purpose.

[00:32:07] Right. I will not send you money in for that purpose anymore. So anyway, and I was still declined because they

[00:32:14] apparently, I was in a blacklist now.

[00:32:17] So

[00:32:18] so

[00:32:19] there's a couple more here I wanted to cover. So one of the issues is simply profit. Right? They don't wanna spend

[00:32:27] a significant

[00:32:28] amount of time helping someone who they're gonna make very little profit off of versus,

[00:32:34] you know, somebody who's bringing in a large pool of capital or whatever that they can they can manage and and profit from.

[00:32:43] So a lot of times they'll just filter you out based on that. Another is simply political targeting. That's not some well, I say that's not something that happens here in The United States.

[00:32:54] I believe it happened in the Biden

[00:32:57] administration,

[00:32:58] the previous administration

[00:33:00] with the

[00:33:03] Jack Mollers talks about it. It happened to him. He went to they

[00:33:08] were

[00:33:11] removed from a bank they'd been in for

[00:33:13] a long time.

[00:33:15] There's no real reason for that

[00:33:18] other than they weren't happy about

[00:33:22] I guess maybe that was more about the Bitcoin than maybe a political affiliation.

[00:33:28] But there was no reason. I mean, that

[00:33:30] I don't know. It's crazy stuff like that. And it's worse in other countries.

[00:33:36] I cannot imagine what's the country? I talked about them a couple weeks ago. Uganda?

[00:33:41] I needed to follow-up on that. Remind me in the news.

[00:33:45] But

[00:33:46] talk about political targeting. I'm sure it would be very rampant in a country like that.

[00:33:52] Okay. Sanctions and capital controls

[00:33:55] also this again is

[00:33:58] more or less in places,

[00:34:00] maybe developing countries.

[00:34:03] But that affects a large number of people.

[00:34:07] Whether they like it or not, the way that these banks are set up, they're simply designed to control everything. They're not designed

[00:34:14] to be

[00:34:16] universally

[00:34:17] accessible

[00:34:17] to everyone. Does that make sense?

[00:34:20] Yeah.

[00:34:22] And we are their customers and it doesn't even feel that we are the customer

[00:34:26] in that way.

[00:34:28] Well,

[00:34:29] the good news is, of course, we can flip this around. You can look at at Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't care who you are. It is permissionless.

[00:34:39] If you've got

[00:34:41] a item

[00:34:43] or money to exchange

[00:34:45] someone for Bitcoin,

[00:34:47] Bitcoin,

[00:34:47] there's no bank involved

[00:34:49] to

[00:34:51] to stop that from happening.

[00:34:53] Okay?

[00:34:55] It's certainly borderless.

[00:34:56] I thought one of the very interesting things about El Salvador,

[00:35:01] to be honest,

[00:35:02] when El Salvador first legalized Bitcoin, this came up a lot.

[00:35:09] Traditionally,

[00:35:10] and I'm sure it to an at least to a large extent, it's still continuing.

[00:35:14] El Salvador receives a lot of what they call remitted

[00:35:19] remitances,

[00:35:20] man. Words,

[00:35:22] remittances,

[00:35:23] which simply means

[00:35:26] someone from El Salvador

[00:35:28] left the family,

[00:35:30] went to The United States, in this case,

[00:35:33] worked,

[00:35:33] made money,

[00:35:35] and they're sending some of it back home

[00:35:39] to support their family.

[00:35:41] That's traditionally

[00:35:43] done through a wire transfer.

[00:35:46] I'm gonna go to a Western Union station

[00:35:48] and I'm gonna wire say 200.

[00:35:51] The problem is the base fee to wire someone is like $25

[00:35:57] or something.

[00:35:59] So in that case,

[00:36:01] it's more than 10%

[00:36:04] just to have that privilege

[00:36:06] of wiring that money.

[00:36:08] And on the other end,

[00:36:11] someone has to go to the Western Union Station to pick up the money,

[00:36:15] which has implications

[00:36:17] beyond just the fact that they have to travel to the station and pick up the money,

[00:36:23] people

[00:36:24] know that they went to the station and picked up the money.

[00:36:29] So they could be targeted for robbery.

[00:36:33] Right. Right?

[00:36:35] So they're literally putting themselves at risk by doing that.

[00:36:41] Bitcoin,

[00:36:42] if I send if I'm from El Salvador and I'm up here, I could send somebody bitcoin,

[00:36:49] it would cost a few Satoshis and

[00:36:52] they would not have to go anywhere.

[00:36:55] Yeah. It would go right to their wallet. Do you see I'm a I mean that's so much simpler and cleaner

[00:37:01] than having

[00:37:02] to do

[00:37:04] that banking system, that traditional banking system which

[00:37:08] sending a wire is is is a part of the banking system. People maybe don't think about it like that but that's exactly

[00:37:16] what it is. You can hold it yourself, of course. We talk about self custody all the time.

[00:37:22] It's so important that you self custody

[00:37:25] when you get to the point in your journey where that

[00:37:29] where you're able to do that.

[00:37:32] And go ahead and tell me what I'm gonna say that you should have.

[00:37:37] Can you see it? A

[00:37:40] cold wallet. Well,

[00:37:42] a cold wallet but specifically,

[00:37:45] this is my Seat Signer. Seat Signer?

[00:37:47] Yeah.

[00:37:48] Seat Signer is good.

[00:37:51] Seat Signers are awesome. I'm about ready I to get a new

[00:37:55] have a Seat Signer, but only for

[00:37:58] experimentation.

[00:37:59] I've never used it

[00:38:01] properly.

[00:38:02] It's my primary driver.

[00:38:04] Yeah. It's good. I love it. I like I like it with the QR codes and everything. I they they've got a newer version now

[00:38:11] that's got a bigger screen and I've talked about this. This is my one

[00:38:15] big beef.

[00:38:17] That screen is too small for somebody like me who has vision problems. Right?

[00:38:24] I am going to get one of their newer ones that has a bigger screen.

[00:38:29] They've like doubled the screen size or whatever. I would I mean, I wouldn't mind it if they had one that was like that big because I don't carry it around all the time. But but it's a Raspberry Pi. You can buy the seven inch Raspberry Pi screen and

[00:38:44] I guess the interface will Well, yeah, it is a Raspberry Pi.

[00:38:47] Yeah. Well, join the seed signer like telegram group and you get hacking on that.

[00:38:54] And I bet they'll take the input and

[00:38:58] you could like

[00:39:00] add code to the thing.

[00:39:03] Sure.

[00:39:04] Censorship resistant.

[00:39:07] Bitcoin doesn't care who your president

[00:39:10] or

[00:39:12] country leader is.

[00:39:14] Doesn't.

[00:39:15] And

[00:39:16] those people can't stop you

[00:39:19] from getting Bitcoin.

[00:39:21] They tried.

[00:39:23] They try

[00:39:24] and maybe it's difficult but it's not impossible. There's anything

[00:39:28] that they do virtually there's a workaround for.

[00:39:32] Yeah.

[00:39:33] And even when Europe tried to ban self custody.

[00:39:37] But, yeah, it's not Thanks for bringing that up. Now we got a downer. I'm just kidding. Right?

[00:39:44] It's not gonna happen. And,

[00:39:46] of course,

[00:39:47] Bitcoin is open source.

[00:39:49] You don't have to depend on a company. We talk about Strike a lot, who makes a Lightning

[00:39:56] wallet and Lightning service.

[00:40:00] Strike

[00:40:01] doesn't run Bitcoin.

[00:40:03] They don't.

[00:40:06] People like Kenshin and I who run nodes

[00:40:10] who mine bitcoin,

[00:40:12] we run the network.

[00:40:15] Doesn't that make you feel good? It makes me feel good. Didn't even say that. We run the network. I think I'm gonna put that on a shirt. We run the network.

[00:40:22] Oh, that's good. That's good. And see, you're not saying Bitcoin so you're not trying but but the people in the know, they know, baby. Yeah. I like that. We run the network.

[00:40:33] Yeah. It it feels now I need to turn on a a second

[00:40:38] a second note.

[00:40:39] I like that. I'm still We run the we should like make that the show title. We run We run Okay. Anyways,

[00:40:46] I need to at least post it on Noster. We run the network. Alright. When I'm listening to this, I'll hear it and I'll go to Noster and post it.

[00:40:54] Alright.

[00:40:57] Bitcoin doesn't ask who you are unlike

[00:41:01] every one of these other banking systems.

[00:41:03] It only asks if you control your keys. Are those your keys?

[00:41:07] You have their your keys?

[00:41:09] Here's your Bitcoin.

[00:41:11] What a great way of looking at it. Yeah. Even your kids can have the wallets.

[00:41:17] They can. And I think they should,

[00:41:20] actually.

[00:41:22] I started with my son already.

[00:41:25] That's to send him some sets.

[00:41:27] Send him some sets.

[00:41:29] And

[00:41:30] kid you cannot do anything with these until you're at least 25 by the way. Not 18 because

[00:41:36] males

[00:41:37] specifically

[00:41:38] their frontal cortex does not finish developing

[00:41:42] until they're 25.

[00:41:44] Okay? That's why 18 year old boys

[00:41:49] in particular

[00:41:50] act so stupid. Sorry.

[00:41:52] Love you, son.

[00:41:56] I have one that's 18.

[00:42:00] Yeah. They're just not developed.

[00:42:03] It's just not so I I personally probably wouldn't be giving them real

[00:42:09] real

[00:42:10] wealth, if you wanna call it that,

[00:42:13] at 18.

[00:42:14] No. I'm DCA ing, but in a cold wallet, so he will not know about it.

[00:42:21] Yeah.

[00:42:22] But yeah. Alright. Some lightning sets. Yeah. No harm.

[00:42:28] Real world examples of this, El Salvador, Nigeria, Argentina, Lebanon.

[00:42:33] I mean, every one of those. Lebanon

[00:42:35] experienced crazy

[00:42:37] currency

[00:42:38] debasement.

[00:42:39] Argentina

[00:42:40] certainly did. Nigeria did as well. El Salvador is actually the only one who really didn't. But El Salvador in particular, I know the whole remittance issue with them. It's like 7% of their GDP.

[00:42:53] And just switching to Bitcoin,

[00:42:56] just all those fees are just essentially gone.

[00:43:00] Yeah. And you hear those stories from people like Chuck Mullers and stuff. They they say in their statistics, could see how much

[00:43:09] Yes. Such and not only such, even stablecoins.

[00:43:13] That's why they enable stablecoins because Right. Countries like Philippines,

[00:43:17] that was a big thing,

[00:43:19] those type of countries.

[00:43:22] So

[00:43:23] in places like Sweden

[00:43:25] No. That's the best one. Or

[00:43:29] The United States,

[00:43:31] even places like China

[00:43:33] and, you

[00:43:35] know, a lot of countries like that,

[00:43:37] Bitcoin is is speculative.

[00:43:39] We we

[00:43:41] a lot of us, not all of us, but a lot of us invest in it because we expect it to go up.

[00:43:47] That's what almost

[00:43:48] always brings people in.

[00:43:50] Oh, Bitcoin go up.

[00:43:53] Some of us figure out along the way Bitcoin can change the world. I feel like I'm there. I'm I don't wanna speak for you. I believe you

[00:44:00] think that. No. But

[00:44:02] Yeah. Yeah.

[00:44:04] For me, I think it's a savings, not investment anymore. So that's that's where my mind clicked Right. In a in a different way. But in a place like Nigeria

[00:44:14] with the e nero,

[00:44:16] I think that's what it's called,

[00:44:18] Bitcoin is is survival.

[00:44:20] Bitcoin is a way to actually break the cycles

[00:44:24] of poverty

[00:44:25] and inability

[00:44:27] to

[00:44:28] to better yourself.

[00:44:31] Lightning,

[00:44:32] one of the great ways of making this work. We don't talk about lightning in particular a whole lot on this show,

[00:44:39] but it is a layer two over Bitcoin.

[00:44:42] So essentially, it's tied into the Bitcoin main network.

[00:44:45] You deal with Satoshis just like you do with Bitcoin.

[00:44:49] But

[00:44:50] unlike the Bitcoin main net where you get a new block every ten minutes,

[00:44:55] I can basically send Kenshin some

[00:44:58] Satoshis instantaneously

[00:45:00] over the Lightning Network. We we've talked about the details of that in the past, but yeah. You

[00:45:08] know, I haven't sent

[00:45:10] Bitcoin in the main net sent.

[00:45:13] I haven't sent in maybe over a year. Wow.

[00:45:17] Hey. All my

[00:45:19] purchases now. These days.

[00:45:21] No. Exactly. But I still prefer Lightning.

[00:45:24] Right.

[00:45:25] And as the network builds,

[00:45:28] as Bitcoin goes up, as

[00:45:30] more traffic is on that main net, the price of sending a transaction

[00:45:35] will happen. Mark my word.

[00:45:39] I wanna think about what I'm about to say. 2026,

[00:45:43] by 2035,

[00:45:46] nine years from now,

[00:45:48] it will cost typically

[00:45:50] more than a $100 to send a transaction

[00:45:53] on the main net. And at that point, you'll be thinking about it very carefully.

[00:45:57] Right?

[00:45:58] Do I need to send this on the main net?

[00:46:01] If I'm gonna pay off my house mortgage,

[00:46:03] I'm gonna send it on the main net. If I'm gonna buy a a Coke,

[00:46:08] I wanna

[00:46:09] use lightning or liquid or something similar. There are other systems.

[00:46:14] Lightning is just frankly the most prevalent.

[00:46:18] Yeah. I I would argue that might not happen.

[00:46:21] Not in nine years.

[00:46:23] Because we go into

[00:46:24] 0.1

[00:46:26] Bitcoin

[00:46:27] Mhmm. SATs right now.

[00:46:29] So we we see below one already, such per v b. Why is it so low?

[00:46:36] Low because the lack of traffic on the network. Is that correct?

[00:46:41] Not really.

[00:46:43] Right, not. I

[00:46:47] mean, the main pool is not empty.

[00:46:49] But it's near empty.

[00:46:51] No. It's not.

[00:46:53] It's 30%. It's a 100 megabytes.

[00:46:57] It's 40,000

[00:46:59] unconfirmed

[00:47:00] transactions.

[00:47:01] 40,000.

[00:47:01] It's 20 blocks. Never argue with Kenshin, Macintosh. I don't know what I was thinking. You're right. It it is 20 blocks.

[00:47:09] People feel like it's empty.

[00:47:11] Right.

[00:47:13] When we get busy

[00:47:15] it'll go up.

[00:47:16] I believe. We'll see. It will but

[00:47:21] I

[00:47:22] guess what I'm betting is that countries

[00:47:26] will start settling

[00:47:28] deals, payments, whatever in Bitcoin.

[00:47:31] They will not be doing it over Lightning. They will do it on the main net.

[00:47:36] Yeah.

[00:47:38] Yeah. For sure. As that traffic picks up,

[00:47:41] I mean,

[00:47:43] it is constricted.

[00:47:44] There's a certain amount of transactions and I don't know what it is offhand,

[00:47:48] but there's only a certain amount that you can send

[00:47:51] over the Bitcoin main net in the course of a week or a year, however you wanna phrase it.

[00:47:57] Yeah. I mean the limitation is the block. Right? And you can send around 4,000

[00:48:01] Right. Per block. Right.

[00:48:03] And there's Best case. Block every ten minutes and you can do the math.

[00:48:08] There's numbers there. That's why people are building things like liquid and

[00:48:13] lightning.

[00:48:14] But

[00:48:16] when enough people are using the main net because

[00:48:19] that's the ultimate settlement.

[00:48:21] When we send a

[00:48:25] when we send a payment to,

[00:48:28] I don't know, Saudi Arabia for oil,

[00:48:31] that's not gonna be done over

[00:48:33] Lightning. It's gonna be done over

[00:48:36] the main net. It doesn't matter

[00:48:38] if it cost a $100

[00:48:41] when

[00:48:41] you're sending

[00:48:43] $5,000,000

[00:48:44] worth of value. I mean, it's nothing.

[00:48:47] Right?

[00:48:48] But

[00:48:49] it's just about scale. Alright. I don't wanna get bogged down in that. I already said 2035.

[00:48:55] Write it down.

[00:48:56] You can say you were right when we get there.

[00:49:01] Do you still think we'll be doing this in 2035?

[00:49:04] No.

[00:49:05] What?

[00:49:10] Oh man.

[00:49:12] Now I'm hurt.

[00:49:15] I'll probably not be in Sweden.

[00:49:19] Hey. I don't know if you know this, but there's this thing called the Internet.

[00:49:23] You don't have to be in one location.

[00:49:27] No. I just think my life will be so different. Wait. My

[00:49:33] son will be old.

[00:49:35] Old. No, he won't. Older.

[00:49:38] Older. He won't even be out of the house. Anyways.

[00:49:41] Alright.

[00:49:42] We really need to There move

[00:49:45] are limitations.

[00:49:47] People need to understand this. They they

[00:49:51] lack of education,

[00:49:52] lack of training,

[00:49:54] lack of teaching, whatever you want to call it,

[00:49:56] simply blocks this process.

[00:49:59] People are not gonna do it on their own.

[00:50:01] We do have infrastructure challenges.

[00:50:04] We do have

[00:50:06] custody risk in cases where people are not self custodying.

[00:50:12] Maybe you've got a fetement set up, which we've talked about some before,

[00:50:18] for

[00:50:19] a group of people. There is a risk there of a rug pull, essentially.

[00:50:24] It's difficult but it can be done.

[00:50:27] And we do have volatility and this is the thing that scares people. They don't understand why there's volatility.

[00:50:33] It's because Bitcoin is of course, it doesn't seem so volatile lately.

[00:50:37] But regardless,

[00:50:40] you know, they're worried about

[00:50:42] losing

[00:50:43] their value.

[00:50:45] Yeah.

[00:50:47] Yeah. Isn't this funny?

[00:50:49] People wonder if volatility debug now.

[00:50:56] We yeah. We're never happy.

[00:50:58] I wanna wrap this up.

[00:51:01] I think one of the most important things that this brings to people

[00:51:06] is their dignity

[00:51:08] and self worth, and I mean that.

[00:51:11] When

[00:51:12] somebody

[00:51:14] lives in a village in Africa

[00:51:16] that's hundreds of kilometers from the nearest

[00:51:19] city

[00:51:20] and they don't have access to a financial infrastructure,

[00:51:25] they do not have the ability to think

[00:51:30] it makes it much more difficult to think long term

[00:51:34] because when

[00:51:35] you save what little bit of money you've got under your pillow

[00:51:39] or

[00:51:40] you know in a jar in a hole in the ground or whatever,

[00:51:46] that's not

[00:51:47] that's not a good system.

[00:51:50] It's very fragile.

[00:51:52] And giving them the ability to have powerful security,

[00:51:57] self custody,

[00:51:58] and be

[00:51:59] a part of

[00:52:01] this global financial

[00:52:05] system that we are building that's got all the benefits that it has, which we've talked about.

[00:52:12] When they understand that and when they grasp that,

[00:52:16] they realize they're equal to anybody in the world. They may not have the same

[00:52:21] ability to make money as say

[00:52:26] somebody who's working at Meta

[00:52:28] or whatever

[00:52:29] but

[00:52:30] they have the ability to participate

[00:52:33] on a level playing field in terms of

[00:52:37] that money. Does that make sense?

[00:52:40] Yeah. It's good.

[00:52:41] And it unleashes something. The things that I see coming out of Africa in terms of development and whatever is just mind boggling.

[00:52:51] And it's because

[00:52:53] you are essentially

[00:52:54] I believe it's because you're essentially

[00:52:57] freeing these people

[00:52:59] in a way that they've never had the ability to before.

[00:53:08] How's that?

[00:53:10] Good.

[00:53:11] Very good. And it already gave us the show notes. Look at that.

[00:53:18] What do we got? Question of the week.

[00:53:22] Yeah. Where is that?

[00:53:24] We

[00:53:25] don't have a question this week, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:53:29] Where can I get that shirt that says we are the network?

[00:53:36] That's the question. Do you would you buy it?

[00:53:40] Here is the question of the week, ladies and gentlemen. If I go out on a limb and make a shirt that says we are the network, would you buy that?

[00:53:48] I need at least a 100 people to boost in and say yes.

[00:53:52] Yeah. And now someone else would do it.

[00:53:55] Yeah.

[00:53:56] Kinda concerning. I need to grab that domain, wearethenetwork.com.

[00:54:02] I bet it's I bet it's already done.

[00:54:06] I can check. Alright.

[00:54:08] Hey, we

[00:54:10] got a boost this week.

[00:54:11] Good to see. Yeah. Friend sending Mike,

[00:54:14] thousand and 69 sats.

[00:54:17] And he said,

[00:54:19] he

[00:54:22] said, I believe Kenshin is approaching the completion of his project

[00:54:27] asymptotically.

[00:54:28] And that's what we were talking about with calculus where you approach the end and you never get there. Right?

[00:54:35] Looking forward to seeing it when it's done. Well, it's done. Send it, Mike. He's got an MVP. Don't let him he's just over there fooling around with chat g b t. Don't you don't worry about that.

[00:54:47] And then he said you talk about the cost to send email. That was the origin of Adam Back's hashcash p o w, a proof of work system

[00:54:56] to eliminate email

[00:54:57] spam. I'm familiar with that. It it is actually the basis

[00:55:02] of

[00:55:03] Bitcoin

[00:55:04] as well.

[00:55:06] That

[00:55:07] idea

[00:55:08] at least.

[00:55:10] Let me go ahead and finish this. I'll come back to that. I'm bullish on Bitcoin though. I'm a little concerned about my outperform silver prediction.

[00:55:18] I personally would prefer the gold and silver price update in ounces. I thought this was maybe a good idea since market cap comparison is hard to make tangible in day to day life. I'd like to do both actually. I don't wanna make it longer but

[00:55:32] maybe we could do what are you sending me? Maybe we could do both.

[00:55:39] Yeah. Of course it is.

[00:55:44] Okay.

[00:55:46] Two two things real quick and I know we're going long so I don't wanna make this too long.

[00:55:51] Yeah. Hashcash,

[00:55:52] I get it. That was about email spam.

[00:55:54] Part of what I'm doing is

[00:55:57] dealing with spam. There's other aspects to it, a lot of other aspects. I don't wanna talk about it too much. I appreciate the input.

[00:56:04] I'm gonna have an MVP on that very soon and once I get things up and rolling. It's going to be open source.

[00:56:12] I'm gonna be looking for people to help, frankly,

[00:56:16] because I can't I'm not gonna do it all by myself.

[00:56:19] I believe

[00:56:21] if I'm correct in my thinking,

[00:56:24] even

[00:56:26] open source, all of that, there will be the opportunity to make money

[00:56:31] by providing a service.

[00:56:34] Okay? Because

[00:56:36] you should get paid for what you're doing.

[00:56:38] And so anyways, we'll talk about all that. I'm bullish on oh, the silver. I did wanna talk about this. I have a thesis actually. I've kinda put it together.

[00:56:50] We all know that gold is basically going up because of inflation. It's kind of predicting

[00:56:55] the printing of money.

[00:56:57] I believe this year in The United States in particular,

[00:57:02] the money printing is about to be unleashed like a like a tsunami.

[00:57:07] I believe personally that silver is basically kind of moving back to its rightful place.

[00:57:14] Silver

[00:57:15] up until

[00:57:16] the

[00:57:17] probably the early seventies, mid seventies.

[00:57:22] How can I put this? It may have been older than that but

[00:57:27] it has a long history of being about 15 to one and you can look this up in terms of price,

[00:57:34] silver to gold. So in other words, 15 ounces of silver,

[00:57:37] one ounce of gold.

[00:57:39] Okay?

[00:57:41] The

[00:57:42] reality is we're nowhere near that right now.

[00:57:45] And in fact, I did a little calculation

[00:57:47] last night.

[00:57:49] When Bitcoin when Bitcoin

[00:57:51] when gold hits $6,000,

[00:57:54] which it's it's going to, I mean, it's just gonna keep going up, it's going to we're at 5,300 or something.

[00:58:03] When it hits 6,000

[00:58:04] a 15 to one ratio

[00:58:07] would be $400

[00:58:10] an ounce for silver.

[00:58:14] Okay? Right.

[00:58:17] Oh.

[00:58:18] And that's the historical

[00:58:20] value ladies and gentlemen. That is not McIntosh just pulling numbers out of thin air.

[00:58:26] That is if you go back in history and look at silver versus gold.

[00:58:32] Silver is more common.

[00:58:35] People don't like it as much as gold, whatever. That is the ratio.

[00:58:41] Okay?

[00:58:42] And there's two things.

[00:58:45] I think well, I think the price was suppressed for a long period of time. I I don't I can't tell you how that was done. I mean, the Hunt brothers, we know tried to corner the market in the past. There's been things like that.

[00:59:00] But

[00:59:02] in a free market where everything is the way it should be,

[00:59:07] we should see this 15 to one ratio.

[00:59:10] And not only are we seeing gold shoot up and we're seeing silver

[00:59:14] follow along behind or really outperform it,

[00:59:18] What's something that silver has a use for? It's not just jewelry,

[00:59:22] it is used in industry.

[00:59:24] And we are in the middle of the largest industrial build out in history

[00:59:30] because of AI. Whether it's a bubble or not, it doesn't matter. It's happening.

[00:59:35] Have a friend of mine. I've never talked about this on the show. He does listen to this occasionally.

[00:59:41] So if he's listening, hi. He's in the electrical business. Okay?

[00:59:47] On a high level.

[00:59:49] And he has talked to me about walking through these giant data centers and these giant industrial

[00:59:56] like the t s m.

[00:59:58] It's the Taiwan

[00:59:59] chip manufacturer.

[01:00:01] I don't know what their initials are but t s building m

[01:00:05] a huge plant

[01:00:07] out in Arizona.

[01:00:08] It is

[01:00:10] mind boggling

[01:00:11] the electrical work and whatever that's being done for that.

[01:00:15] All of that stuff

[01:00:17] is driving demand

[01:00:19] for silver from an industrial aspect.

[01:00:23] I don't know when silver is going to get back to that 15 to one ratio and I am not making price predictions ladies and gentlemen, but I do believe

[01:00:32] one day,

[01:00:34] hopefully within my lifetime,

[01:00:36] that we're back to that in general kind of 15 to one ratio.

[01:00:43] So are we the silver plebs soon? No. We're not.

[01:00:48] I

[01:00:49] own zero gold. I own very little silver.

[01:00:52] And by the way, I have not bought any silver since it started running up. So I'm not a a

[01:00:59] jump on the bandwagon person.

[01:01:02] Okay? I hope it does well but it's just a hard asset to me that I bought before I knew about Bitcoin.

[01:01:10] Does that make sense?

[01:01:12] I

[01:01:13] I would not spend thousands of dollars on silver these days. If I had that kind of money to spend

[01:01:19] on on

[01:01:20] an asset, it would be Bitcoin

[01:01:23] 100%.

[01:01:26] Send it, Mike. I really would like to sit down with you and talk. I know we've said that before or at least I have.

[01:01:32] Kenshin doesn't think you'll go across the Atlantic, so whatever.

[01:01:36] But,

[01:01:38] yeah, you and I think a lot alike. It's interesting because we don't in some ways but a lot of ways we do. We'd love to sit down and have a drink.

[01:01:46] Think wasn't he the one that said something about the Buffalo Ranch that you wanted to come out to the ranch? I think it was.

[01:01:52] Yeah. Was that Anyways, somebody

[01:01:55] once I get the ranch up and running, know,

[01:01:58] I guess you're welcome to come out.

[01:02:03] You'll have to like prove that you're you and

[01:02:07] then I'll let you know where it's at.

[01:02:09] Alright. That's enough. We're we're done. Oh, news and notes.

[01:02:13] We're done with that.

[01:02:16] News and notes. I I have one item and it's not the price of silver.

[01:02:22] It Yeah. Is

[01:02:23] What's going on in the mining market? Right?

[01:02:27] Wow. We know

[01:02:29] right now

[01:02:30] if the difficulty adjustment were to happen today,

[01:02:35] we would be down 18%

[01:02:37] in difficulty.

[01:02:39] Okay?

[01:02:40] Which is

[01:02:42] and I don't know that this is what's gonna happen. We're ten days out from the next difficulty adjustment. So we've got a ways to go.

[01:02:49] But right now, I don't think we've ever had a drop this big. I would have to go back and look at the data but

[01:02:56] it that's what it seems. That's a

[01:02:59] staggering drop in one in one difficulty adjustment.

[01:03:03] And it's because

[01:03:05] The US is in the middle of a deep freeze and

[01:03:11] Texas in particular which hosts a huge number of minors,

[01:03:15] they have this deal a lot of them with ERCOT,

[01:03:18] the energy

[01:03:19] consortium or whatever.

[01:03:21] And when ERCOT needs that energy,

[01:03:25] the Bitcoin miners shut down. And that's what's going on right now, I believe.

[01:03:29] This isn't China mining ban. This isn't, you know, it's it's pure we see this every year with the weather, at least the last few years, but we've never seen it to this extent.

[01:03:40] Now my miners happen to all be online unless they're in for repair. I've got a few like that. So I'm happy cause this is benefiting me.

[01:03:49] I looked actually at the ocean statistics

[01:03:53] a few last night.

[01:03:55] We've mined like 52 blocks this month.

[01:03:59] Wow.

[01:04:00] Yeah. It's crazy. 52?

[01:04:03] Yeah. Like two a day.

[01:04:05] Actually the pool hash has gone down not up.

[01:04:09] So

[01:04:11] that's kinda crazy.

[01:04:13] I'm I'm happy with that.

[01:04:15] But yeah, we're we're crazy

[01:04:18] crazy low on the price.

[01:04:21] What else were we got? Was there any other news? Zeus

[01:04:24] for software updates. I know Zeus had a 12 dot two dot two I think came out.

[01:04:29] I I reboosted

[01:04:31] it earlier

[01:04:34] or last night or this morning. I don't remember which. But they're just always turning out stuff but it looks like they have a

[01:04:41] a an actual full release, not a like an alpha or a beta.

[01:04:47] So if you're using Zeus, you should do that.

[01:04:51] Let's see.

[01:04:54] Bit Bit Chat has has had some good news. Okay. You wanna go ahead and I don't know about that. Please share.

[01:05:01] Yes. It I'm sorry, but it's zero dot twelve dot two. Yeah.

[01:05:04] Okay. Zeus.

[01:05:07] Bit chat supports now photos audio notes in Bluetooth mesh.

[01:05:12] It has better routing algorithm

[01:05:15] for stable and longer range meshes,

[01:05:18] uses TOR projects and

[01:05:21] RT framework

[01:05:23] for speed and reliability.

[01:05:25] I don't know what is that. RT framework.

[01:05:30] And it's now audited by third party security group and addressed all findings.

[01:05:35] That's good.

[01:05:37] Good to hear that, especially when you're dealing with people's lives

[01:05:42] as sometimes is the case here.

[01:05:45] For those of you who don't know, a bit chat is a

[01:05:49] Bluetooth based tool that builds a mesh network

[01:05:52] for communication.

[01:05:54] So if you have a large group of people, say

[01:05:58] protesters in Iran,

[01:06:00] people could have this as a way to

[01:06:03] talk

[01:06:05] and

[01:06:06] the

[01:06:07] government

[01:06:08] cannot shut it down. You can't block Bluetooth like that. You can block the cellular data, which is what they do. They shut down the cell towers or whatever in the area. That kind of thing.

[01:06:19] Doesn't work the same way for Bluetooth. So people can communicate

[01:06:24] if there's enough of them using it in in a given area

[01:06:29] and it works very very well from what I hear.

[01:06:32] Mhmm.

[01:06:33] Really cool stuff.

[01:06:34] Glad to hear it.

[01:06:36] We did not try it

[01:06:39] and see if we can send a message

[01:06:41] between us.

[01:06:44] I don't think it's gonna reach.

[01:06:46] No.

[01:06:50] Complete random

[01:06:51] not no. Nope. Not doing it.

[01:06:55] Not doing it.

[01:06:59] I'm exercising

[01:07:00] my

[01:07:02] don't go down that rabbit trail.

[01:07:05] I need a price. I did not update price.

[01:07:10] I

[01:07:11] don't even know where to look for price these days.

[01:07:14] Go charting.

[01:07:16] I had the links there. Okay. I've got a price right now of 88,981

[01:07:23] in US dollars.

[01:07:25] What do you have, sir?

[01:07:27] I have

[01:07:29] the up to date is 74,466

[01:07:34] I

[01:07:36] heard some kind of sad news.

[01:07:38] It looks like we close out this month.

[01:07:42] We'll be down for the fourth month in a row.

[01:07:45] Okay. Not good. But we haven't gone down. I mean, 88,000,

[01:07:49] I still it's 30%.

[01:07:52] You people,

[01:07:53] if you think this is bad,

[01:07:55] nah.

[01:07:57] Nah.

[01:07:58] It's just not.

[01:07:59] Try 50. Try 70. Try 80%

[01:08:03] drawdown.

[01:08:04] And maybe that's what still happens in the end. We don't know. But

[01:08:08] it seems to me like I keep saying we just kinda keep

[01:08:12] we're in this little box. You know? We're just kinda bouncing back and forth. I don't know.

[01:08:20] Let's go ahead do the market cap. We got $1,800,000,000,000

[01:08:23] US in for Bitcoin,

[01:08:26] 33,100,000,000,000.0

[01:08:28] for gold. Do you even remember what it was when we started doing this? I it was in the twenties. Right? The lower twenties

[01:08:35] for gold? I think below maybe then. Maybe. Yeah. Actually actually now right now, it's it's even more.

[01:08:42] Wait.

[01:08:45] Wait. Wait. 37,000,000,000,000.

[01:08:47] Bitcoin was at like, we touched 10% at one point, the Bitcoin versus gold market gap, and now we're down to 5.4.

[01:08:54] Oh, 37,000,000,000,000

[01:08:55] for the gold market gap. Yep.

[01:08:58] Crazy stuff. And, of course, silver has shot up. We were look silver's now the number two asset. Right?

[01:09:04] Right behind gold? Yeah. It is. Yeah. It is. Yeah.

[01:09:09] Just a few months ago, it was like seven or eight. I mean, it's just insane what silver's been doing.

[01:09:15] Yeah. Not financial advice people.

[01:09:17] It could go down to 50. It could go down to, I don't know,

[01:09:21] 25.

[01:09:24] Just saying.

[01:09:26] But it is interesting.

[01:09:28] And I will operate on that thesis I outlined until

[01:09:32] otherwise proven. Wrong fees and mimple.

[01:09:35] Oh, you wanna hit that? Sorry. Oh, no. No. That's an old one. Okay.

[01:09:41] Fees. So we are at

[01:09:43] one sat per v bytes. That's If it's a high priority. Yeah. Oh. That's now high. Go for it. Half.

[01:09:52] Yeah. And low priority

[01:09:54] is 0.1 SAT per v byte. And I saw one transactions I picked up on random that had 0.13

[01:10:01] SATs,

[01:10:02] and they paid a total of 16 sets

[01:10:06] for the transaction, which is $0.01.

[01:10:10] We should make a web page on the website,

[01:10:14] Kenshin and and Macintosh bets

[01:10:18] put

[01:10:19] $20.35

[01:10:21] cost. Oh, no.

[01:10:25] 4.82

[01:10:26] percent of the way to the next happening.

[01:10:29] Habit happening

[01:10:30] And that's gonna be on April 12. It slid back a day because everything's behind.

[01:10:35] In 2028, two years, seventy four days.

[01:10:38] And we are, as I said, when I wrote this down, 18 o 7%

[01:10:44] downward adjustment in like eleven days.

[01:10:48] Yes. Love

[01:10:50] it. Love it.

[01:10:51] It's the I think the fourth downward third or fourth downward adjustment in a row as well. Yeah.

[01:10:58] I mean Yeah.

[01:11:00] But I mean when you zoom out we are at a level higher than That's why I wanted to go down. That means that servers are going offline.

[01:11:09] Yeah. Exactly. I mean August we were at where we are now basically.

[01:11:14] It's Look. So bad. If I woke up tomorrow and Marathon

[01:11:19] had pivoted

[01:11:21] to AI and shut down every one of their Bitcoin servers,

[01:11:26] I would be extremely happy.

[01:11:29] Bitbet Farm by the way is doing that. I mean they're they they closed down their Paraguay businesses as public news

[01:11:36] and they're pivoting

[01:11:37] more to AI. They say they're gonna maintain like a mix but I believe in the long run they're just gonna become a because they make more profit per space

[01:11:49] for AI Sure. Right

[01:11:51] Yeah. Sure. But they need different hardware. Not so easy It's the mindset thing. You're right. But

[01:11:57] they think, oh for the same amount of

[01:12:01] energy It's we can make more

[01:12:03] just pure fiat thinking. They're not thinking in the long run.
