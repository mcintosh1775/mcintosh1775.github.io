New York State has a bill that is waiting on the Governor to sign that would ban proof of work mining. This would mean that companies would not be allowed to set up new bitcoining mining operations in the state after the bill is passed.

Even with the state Assembly and Senate passing the bill, there is no guarantee it will be signed into law. The governor is now saying that the bill will need to be looked at very closely.
