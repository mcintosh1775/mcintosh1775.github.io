00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey SatStackers, today is March 27th and this is episode 101 of Generation Bitcoin.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm your host McIntosh. Today's episode is about the 4 year cycle.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,680
Of course no one on this podcast is a financial advisor and all information presented on this

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,960
podcast is for informational purposes only. Now that we have the legal stuff out of the way,

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:58,240
let's jump on in. All right, the tea is hot. The market doing okay. We'll talk about that

6
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,720
just a second. But I wanted to have a discussion tonight about the 4 year cycle. If you've never

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,840
heard of that, it's a theory that basically the halvings of Bitcoin, which we have discussed

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:23,440
before most recently in depth back in episode 93, but the halvings of Bitcoin drive a price cycle

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,560
that we can map out over the last 12 years or so and we can see that pattern. So we'll be

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:42,800
discussing that tonight. All right, March the 27th. So we did have a closing price this week

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:55,520
of Bitcoin at $28,001.04 actually. So that's pretty good.

12
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Since I didn't cover price last week due to me being out of town or the market analysis,

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,320
I thought it might make sense to kind of dive into this for a few minutes. So

14
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,720
let's discuss where we are and where we have been over the last few weeks. So of course,

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,520
we continue in this general uptrend. Things are looking pretty positive on a one day time frame.

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,880
What that means is that a one day time frame is 24 hours. Of course, every candle on the

17
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,680
charts is 24 hours. We have a pretty positive upswing. In fact, it goes now at this point

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:53,040
all the way back technically, wow, to January the 1st. So we hit our low back on November the

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,200
20th, if you recall. Which I believe, yeah, November the 21st, excuse me.

20
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,840
And it looks like our price was right around $15,585. So around $15,600 or so.

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:17,360
And we have certainly been in an uptrend. We have actually been going up since the 10th of March.

22
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,320
We took a dip before that. For a couple of weeks, we went downward. And then on the 10th of March,

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,720
we have went up. We've been sideways for roughly the last week or so. I'm not counting candles here

24
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,840
specifically, but it looks like about six to seven days from what I'm seeing. So there is a

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:48,240
possibility certainly at this level, if it does not break through kind of this 28,000 level

26
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,480
and move a bit higher, we could kind of see a pause here and kind of turn back down.

27
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,720
So there we go. When I recorded last week, in fact, let me see.

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,800
There's the 19th. I recorded on the 18th, right? We had basically just got up to this level.

29
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,000
And of course, with the run that we had made over the course of the previous week,

30
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,720
it's quite normal for things to kind of pause a bit, but we've now been kind of paused for a week.

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
So we're going to have a direction one way or the other here, I would say, within the next few days.

32
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,320
We will see. I would like to see it, of course, from a bull standpoint, continue on upward.

33
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
It is very possible, though, that we could break back down for a little bit

34
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,640
and maybe establish a lower level of support. We'll see. As always, of course, my advice is to DCA.

35
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,120
You should be buying Sats, stacking sats every day, regardless of the market.

36
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
Now, I say that.

37
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,760
And to an extent, I've taught a bit about this. There are some times when you may want to buy more.

38
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:20,080
I've told you all, if the price got down to what I perceive as very low levels at this point,

39
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:32,240
I bought a little chunk at that low of $15.50 or so. That was certainly a low level, given

40
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,000
where we've been. I was hoping, I know it sounds bad, but I was hoping it was going to go lower.

41
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,000
If we were down to that $10,000 or $12,000 level, I was going to

42
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,440
push all my capital in and buy as much as I could. Of course, that hasn't happened.

43
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,120
But what we're going to discuss tonight may actually help you in planning your future.

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,080
Now, I, again, would caution. What I'm about to tell you does not negate a DCA.

45
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,960
You should always DCA, even if it's a very minimal amount.

46
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,120
I consider, at this point, my mining to be my DCA. And just to give you guys an update on that,

47
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,040
actually, I'll do one. I think I maybe even said last week, I wasn't going to give any more updates,

48
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:34,240
but I'm going to give you one more. The reason why is, hold on just a second.

49
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm going to bring up my chart. I've never told y'all, as you can tell, I have a fairly noisy

50
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:53,520
keyboard. I type a lot and I'm quite particular about my keyboard. In fact, for my work laptop,

51
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:03,440
for my work computer, I should say, I typically use a MacBook of some kind of 13 inch or whatever,

52
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,840
15 inch MacBook Pro. I find the Apple keyboards, in fact, to be quite

53
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,560
dissatisfactory because they don't have any travel to the keys, essentially.

54
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll give you a little inside baseball. I've been at the company that I'm at for

55
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,960
five years or so. In that time, I've actually worn out three Apple keyboards.

56
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm a fairly hard typer in case you can't tell from when I type on my keyboard, but I have actually

57
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,000
worn out three of these and had to send them back for repairs. I'm not saying to those Apple purists

58
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,200
out there that Apple is not the best hardware in the world, blah, blah, blah. I actually do

59
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,320
like Apple hardware in particular. What I would love to get is probably a Mac Studio. I think

60
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Mac Studio, I think that's what they call it, with the ARM chipset CPUs. Those are,

61
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,320
well, without turning this into a hardware podcast, those are, in my opinion, some of

62
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,320
the best chips you can buy these days. I really like the ARM chipset. I actually,

63
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:29,120
uh, anyways, I can't afford it. It doesn't matter, but the Apple keyboard is something that I

64
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,480
basically have a problem with. Sorry. Got sides right there, but a little bit of trivia.

65
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,040
So when you hear that keyboard, that's my keyboard. It's a DAS actually, D-A-S keyboard.

66
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,600
And it's an old style. If you looked at it, it looked like a kind of the old school IBM

67
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:57,200
XT or whatever they called them keyboards. Big keys, springs, real actual springs that depress

68
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,960
when you press the key. Sorry. Mining update. So I did complete a month and I did some figures,

69
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,640
which I wanted to share with y'all. And I'm going to kind of, so I have two miners. They both run

70
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,560
at 104 tera hash. They're S 19 J pros. I think is the model. I can look it up real quick to make

71
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,920
sure I'm telling you the right thing. Yes, it's an S 19 J pro. So if you're curious, you can look

72
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,280
that up. They both produce 104 tera hash. So combined tera hash should be around 208,

73
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:45,120
which is roughly what I've observed. I'm using the brains B-R-A-I-I-N-S mining pool.

74
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,520
It's actually one of the oldest, if not the oldest, I think it may be the oldest

75
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,080
mining pool around at this point. And I would like to explore, they have some firmware updates for

76
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:07,280
the amp miner S 19 J unit that should improve the performance by about 10%. If I can get my

77
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,920
mining company kaboom racks to install those. So for the same wattage, for the same

78
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:23,840
power that the server uses, it should be more efficient. I don't honestly know how that happens.

79
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,960
I don't know what efficiencies, how they're managing that. I have not dug into it that

80
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,880
deeply, but it should improve it by about 10%, which means each one of these units would then

81
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,800
be getting around 112 or so tera hash, which doesn't sound like a whole lot, but it adds up,

82
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,440
especially if you have a much larger pool. And 10% is nothing to sneeze at. That means

83
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
if I were to run these long enough to mine a Bitcoin, which I don't know if they'll

84
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,160
last that long, the typical unit like this should last about four years before it's no longer useful,

85
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,880
not efficient enough to mine at that point, essentially. I don't know, I should be actually

86
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,280
in total for both of them around one Bitcoin, if I've done my math correctly. And things proceed as

87
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,880
I would like them to, which I have no control over, of course, but let's say I did that.

88
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,080
Well, that's 0.1 Bitcoin, which is even today is $2,000. So it's a lot of money

89
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
that we're really talking about. So that's something that I'm working on.

90
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:42,480
Here's the way it broke down. I mined at the time that it was mined so roughly in the $27,000 range

91
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:53,440
about $300 and no, right at $400. It was right at $400. That's what it was.

92
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,560
So $400 in value that I mined with the two units. So you could break it down at $200

93
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:12,400
for each unit if you want to look at it that way. The hosting fee was $363 this year.

94
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
That's what they got. Now, I also had a $13 fee because of the way that I sent it because we didn't

95
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:31,120
have an ACH set up. I consider that to be part of it. So $376. So I made roughly $25 on the two units,

96
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,440
which isn't very much, especially considering the cost of the units. So that's discouraging.

97
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Now, two factors.

98
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Factor number one, given what I'm understanding at this point about the miners

99
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,840
and my background as a system administrator, I believe that easily with the proper tooling,

100
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,000
one person could manage a thousand miners. Now, that sounds like an extremely

101
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,320
great deal of servers, but if you have the right skill set and the right tools, that is possible.

102
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:18,160
So if you take $12 times $1,000, that's $12,000 per month. Now, does that cover the unit costs

103
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,320
themselves? No, obviously it does not. That's purely the hosting slash electricity cost.

104
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,040
So the reality is, I think I told you this, I spent $1,774 or so, 76, something like that.

105
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,360
It was somewhere right around there per unit to buy the unit itself. After four years,

106
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,320
I might be able to sell it for a few hundred dollars. So that's item number one, which means

107
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,960
essentially I have to calculate that into the price as part of my loss, essentially.

108
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:04,880
Now, at $12 a month, you can't do that. I mean, what is that? $12, you can do the math real quick.

109
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:17,040
$12 times 12, 144, of course, times four, which means in a four-year time span, $576,

110
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
which essentially means no profit.

111
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,280
But what this doesn't account for is Bitcoin going up or down in price. Now, as we will talk

112
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,000
about tonight, I believe we are at the bottom or near the bottom or whatever you want to call it

113
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,840
of this cycle. So it's only going to go up from here. And sorry, my dog is barking. And as the

114
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,040
price of Bitcoin moves up, the Bitcoin that I hold becomes more valuable. So if we were only to go

115
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:01,360
back up to $70,000 at the top of the next cycle, then we're looking at roughly three times. So that

116
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,600
$12 per unit then becomes $24, $36 per month. So that becomes a little more palatable. You can

117
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,400
figure that out. But what I have, and I was expecting this essentially to be a little bit

118
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,400
more complicated, but I'm going to go ahead and do that. So I'm going to go ahead and do that.

119
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:32,480
You can figure that out. But what I have, and I was expecting this, essentially, I knew that

120
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,560
this is not a high-profit business. I think there will be time periods when the margin gets better.

121
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,680
But you're not going to buy one miner and become rich on it. Now,

122
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,440
Now, I'm not doing this really as a business, I am, but I'm not, if that makes sense.

123
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,380
I'm doing this as a way to support the network, I'm doing this as a way to generate more Bitcoin

124
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,520
for myself that I will hold.

125
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm not looking to become rich on mining Bitcoin, but even though that's the case, I still have

126
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,520
to keep track of all this so that I make sure I'm not underwater.

127
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,880
So what will happen over time is these servers, they won't become less efficient, but there

128
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,940
will be more efficient servers that come out.

129
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:30,280
The network difficulty will get harder over time, and because of that, these servers will

130
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,580
generate less Satoshis.

131
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,880
So they essentially will become less efficient.

132
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,720
Now, if the price of those Satoshis is going up, you know, if you have access to cheap

133
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,680
power, you can still mine with S9s, which are quite ancient at this point.

134
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,960
So it's all in kind of your cost, the two costs, well, the one cost that you can really

135
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,400
control is electricity.

136
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:11,440
I pay $0.079 or cents, almost eight cents per kilowatt, which is okay.

137
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,880
It's not super expensive, but it's not cheap.

138
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:24,000
Eventually, I would like to get much cheaper electricity.

139
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,160
If my electricity is two cents per kilowatt, well, then basically anything makes sense

140
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:40,000
and you stack everything in there and generate Bitcoin because I've essentially quadrupled

141
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,200
my profit because it's one quarter of the cost for my electricity.

142
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,520
I think I did that math right.

143
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
So there you go.

144
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,880
That's all we're going to talk about that.

145
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,560
I don't want to turn this into a Bitcoin mining podcast.

146
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,880
Y'all might be bored.

147
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't have enough experience at it.

148
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,160
But that being said, if you have interest, I would certainly...

149
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,760
It is a good time to buy Bitcoin miner.

150
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,680
The prices are down.

151
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:17,840
I believe that in general, electricity is going to go up.

152
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,400
I have a contract with Kaboom Racks for one year that locks in the price of electricity.

153
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,160
If electricity is more expensive at the end of that time in general and they have to raise

154
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,920
their prices, I do believe the price of Bitcoin itself will be significantly higher as well.

155
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,160
That will be okay.

156
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
You could certainly run this at home.

157
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,320
They are noisy, as I'm sure you've probably heard, but there are ways to mitigate that.

158
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,840
But you have to pay to run it if you're essentially plugging in a powerful microwave and running

159
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,880
that microwave 24-7.

160
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,720
These units are 3050 watts, if I'm not mistaken.

161
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm looking at buying one more that's a more recent unit, actually, and I don't recall

162
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,240
the unit itself.

163
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:19,920
It's another Ant miner, but it's 140 tera hash and it's almost the exact same power,

164
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
if I'm not mistaken.

165
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,240
In fact, it might be the same power.

166
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,320
So you can understand if I'm generating almost 40% more tera hash for the same power, see

167
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,200
again that profit margin.

168
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,600
Now the unit itself is more expensive.

169
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,600
That's the downside, but it should retain its value for significantly longer than these

170
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,200
units will.

171
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,280
So there's a trade-off there.

172
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
That's the way it goes.

173
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,160
So all right, enough about that.

174
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,040
Let's talk about the four-year cycle.

175
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,080
I think this will be an interesting topic.

176
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,880
This is something that has been around for a long time.

177
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,400
I've probably even mentioned it on here before, but I felt like it was time to actually spend

178
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,040
an episode and discuss it.

179
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,520
So first of all, what do I mean by a four-year cycle?

180
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,680
If you will recall, we have Bitcoin halvings every four years, roughly.

181
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,680
It's a certain fixed number of blocks.

182
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,320
And I actually have that written down in here somewhere.

183
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Halvings occur every 210,000 blocks.

184
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
So there's a clever little play there.

185
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,360
Of course, there's 21 million Bitcoin that will be mined in total.

186
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,440
Halvings occur every 210,000 blocks.

187
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,240
The next halving will occur at block height of 840,000.

188
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,360
And that will occur roughly in April of 2024.

189
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,760
The first Bitcoin halving occurred in November, November the 28th of 2012.

190
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,720
Before the halving, the block reward was 50 Bitcoin per block.

191
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,360
Afterwards, it was 25.

192
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,040
It halved Bitcoin per block.

193
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,360
The second halving occurred on July the 9th of 2016, quote, four years later.

194
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Clearly, it's not.

195
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,560
And there will be a time when it won't be four years.

196
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,360
It'll be like three years and whatever.

197
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
And I think maybe that'll kind of throw people off.

198
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Keep in mind, it's the number of blocks, not the actual date.

199
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,320
So July the 9th, 2016.

200
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,680
Before the halving, the block reward was 25.

201
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Afterwards it was, wait for it, 12.5 Bitcoin per block.

202
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
The third halving occurred just a couple years ago.

203
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:59,280
Well, three years ago now almost on May the 11th of 2020.

204
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,880
Before the halving, the block reward was 12.5.

205
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,500
Afterwards, it was 6.25 Bitcoin per block.

206
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,140
Of course, that is our current value.

207
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:17,240
When a block is mined by any miner, we get 6.5 Bitcoin for that block.

208
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,840
So that's what, 120,000 plus a bit.

209
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
Okay, I'm not going to do that math.

210
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,200
It's 140 something thousand.

211
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,600
Okay, so the next one does occur.

212
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
It's going to be sometime in April or May.

213
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,240
I think I've seen both.

214
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,800
I think as we get closer, it'll get a more definite date.

215
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,380
But it does occur at block height, 840,000.

216
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:53,140
So when I do my recordings and I either say or have it in the show notes, in fact, this

217
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,700
recording is taking place at block height.

218
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Where did I put it?

219
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh my goodness, I'm so discompobulated this week.

220
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,380
There it is, 782,674.

221
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,980
The astute among you might go, but McIntosh, when are you ever organized?

222
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,100
I try.

223
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,140
People have their weaknesses.

224
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:20,060
I'm at least aware of this particular one and I do things to work on that.

225
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,660
But I probably shouldn't be saying I'm disorganized, but it is a reality that it is a struggle

226
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,820
for me.

227
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,700
And so anyways, okay.

228
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
So there you go.

229
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
We've got our halvings.

230
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,120
We've got the next one coming in 2024.

231
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,720
And the block height will or the block reward will go from 6.25 down to 3.125.

232
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,920
Yes, I think that's correct.

233
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:01,520
Again, we're having it and that continues all the way out to 2140 when we reach the

234
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,320
end and one day we'll have a discussion about what happens then.

235
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,060
The short answer is nobody really knows because the miners won't continue to mine blocks

236
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,600
of Bitcoin.

237
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,900
There will need to be other incentives to keep these machines on the network.

238
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,440
And if the machines, if the block miners aren't on the network taking care of business, so

239
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,980
to speak, then you don't have a safe network.

240
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,020
So it is an issue.

241
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,420
It also happens to be more than a hundred years in the future.

242
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,520
And frankly, I am quite confident that we can resolve that problem.

243
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,080
There are several theories floating around about what to do.

244
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,160
Okay, the halving does what?

245
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:53,200
It provides a mechanism for a diminishing, for diminishing the rate of inflation, so

246
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,560
to speak, of the Bitcoin supply.

247
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,440
So what does that mean?

248
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,660
We've got a supply of Bitcoin that's growing.

249
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,780
We're at 19 million, whatever, I don't know exactly.

250
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,900
As these halvings occur, the amount of Bitcoin that gets mined gets lower and lower.

251
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,780
That rate of inflation, in other words, how many Bitcoin are there this year versus next

252
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,220
year, slows down.

253
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,620
Now, if our own federal government could operate under that idea, but that's a different story.

254
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,260
Until ultimately there will be no inflation because the supply will have been reached

255
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,260
to 21 million Bitcoin and there won't be any more being mined.

256
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:48,420
That's why every Satoshi is precious and we shouldn't be throwing them away.

257
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:55,100
Historically, so it's these halvings that give us the idea of a four-year cycle.

258
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,740
Every four years, this reduction leads to a price increase.

259
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,460
Historical data now that we're already three halvings in, coming up on our fourth one,

260
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,900
have given a lot of credence to that, actually.

261
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm going to be posting some trading view charts that you could take a look at that

262
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,660
show how these have done in the past.

263
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,880
You can be your own judge.

264
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,740
You don't have to believe me.

265
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:34,380
You can believe the data, but what seems to happen is that when we reach a peak roughly

266
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,440
every four years, we reach a bottom roughly every four years.

267
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,960
You can kind of start to chart this out.

268
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,520
So you see a four-year top, you see a four-year bottom.

269
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:52,960
Now interesting thing, that top is not at the halving, which on first glance might seem

270
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,160
to be the obvious location, if you want to call it that.

271
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,600
Oh, we've reached the halving.

272
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,480
Here's our all-time high and it goes down after that.

273
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,640
That's not what we see.

274
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,560
There's kind of an inflection point when we reach that halving point, but prior to that,

275
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:24,160
we have a build-up, we reach the halving, and then post halving, you continue to go

276
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,360
up to reach that all-time high.

277
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,440
You have around a two-year recovery, if you want to call it that.

278
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,380
So this is when our price is low ahead of a halving.

279
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:51,360
So if our next halving is 2024, we would go see that in 2023 and in 2022.

280
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,000
And in this case, our all-time high was actually in 2021.

281
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,880
Essentially, we had the bears certainly controlling 2022, so prices were down.

282
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,600
And 2023, I would say so far, has looked like pretty positive.

283
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,240
We've reached this low that we talked about, 15,000 or whatever, 600, it depends on what

284
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,120
exchange you're looking at and maybe even how closely you're looking at the data.

285
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,280
But it's around 15,600, and that was reached at November, so that was our low.

286
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:38,160
And I mean, if you look at this on a higher time frame, it stayed right around that level

287
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,040
for the rest of the year.

288
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,840
And then in January, it starts tracing upwards.

289
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:54,120
Now, don't put too much credence on what year, because again, it's kind of this, it relates

290
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,640
to the block number, not the date.

291
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,880
So that does tend to vary a little bit.

292
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,960
But of course, if those halvings occur roughly every four years, again, we're going to have

293
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,640
this four-year cycle.

294
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,400
So if we spend a couple of years after the all-time high, kind of going down and then

295
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,680
sideways and getting that recovery going, well, and then we spend a couple of years

296
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:32,320
going between there, so to speak, and the next all-time high, the next top.

297
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
Let's go back for just a second.

298
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
This will probably make it clear.

299
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,720
So if we have two-year recovery, you got a year-long run after that, and then a year-long

300
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,320
bear market, 2021 was a bullish year like 2017, and that's true.

301
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,960
We had our all-time high in 2021.

302
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,640
In November, we had an all-time high in 2017.

303
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,240
If I'm not mistaken, it was in December of 2017.

304
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,800
It's when Bitcoin hit $20,000.

305
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,000
I remember that night distinctly, to be honest, because I was very actively trading at that

306
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,120
point, and I did not believe that it was going to stop, and I didn't sell anything.

307
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,520
I've talked about this before, and I held onto it all as it went back down.

308
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,840
Maybe not the best thing in the world to do.

309
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:31,680
The bears have controlled 2022, and after that all-time high in 2021, and of course,

310
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:40,640
2023, we're only a quarter into it, essentially, three months, but it's certainly looking promising.

311
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,960
So what are we looking at as we go forward?

312
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,220
We've got a halving date of April of 2024, so roughly one year for now, and then we will

313
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,220
probably have an all-time high around the fourth quarter of 2025, according to this.

314
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,100
I would argue possibly November, although it's certainly way too early to be saying

315
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,420
stuff like that.

316
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,500
It would be funny if it were Thanksgiving Day of 2025 here in the United States.

317
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,240
It's the fourth Thursday of November.

318
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,900
This may be a little confusing.

319
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,720
If you look at a chart, this is a point where I would love to have video.

320
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,400
It would help this a lot.

321
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm going to post a couple of charts on Twitter.

322
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
You can take a look.

323
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:32,600
I'll put them on Mastodon and Noster maybe as well, and if you follow me on those accounts,

324
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,680
then you can take a look at that.

325
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,400
But you will see the data, you'll see the lows, you'll see the highs.

326
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,600
One of them has what they call an accumulation zone marked out as well, and I find that to

327
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,680
be very helpful, and this is what I was talking about.

328
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes, I want you to do DCA.

329
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,840
If you're putting $5 a day, if you're putting $100 a week, I don't know what your investments

330
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
are.

331
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,480
That's your business, not mine, but you need to be doing that, and I believe that you need

332
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,120
to be doing that on a daily basis, even if it's a very small amount.

333
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,520
But there are, I would say inarguably, better times to buy Bitcoin.

334
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:23,000
Would you rather buy Bitcoin when it's at $15,000 to $20,000 to maybe $30,000 even,

335
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,780
or would you rather buy it at $60,000 to $120,000?

336
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,260
You tell me.

337
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:37,600
We FOMO in at the top, FOMO means fear of missing out, because the excitement is so

338
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:45,120
much, but that is literally the worst time to buy Bitcoin, to hold it, if that's your

339
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,120
goal.

340
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Do I want to be buying Bitcoin at $69,000 like it when it hit the last all-time high?

341
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:01,640
No, because it won't be back at that point for probably a little bit longer, okay?

342
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,920
And until we reach that point, it's not even breakeven.

343
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,520
If I sold it, which of course I wouldn't be, but if I sold it, it would be at a loss.

344
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,480
The best time to buy is these accumulation zones.

345
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,560
This time frame, this roughly 18 months or so, during this downturn, that's when you

346
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,920
don't want to buy at the top.

347
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,520
You don't want to buy at $50,000 if we're looking at the last one.

348
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,440
You probably don't want to buy at $40,000, but you want to start feeding in, am I buying

349
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
at $30,000?

350
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Am I buying?

351
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
I'll buy a little more at $20,000.

352
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,880
I don't know what's going to keep going down.

353
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,120
I want to buy a little extra at $19,000, $18,000, $15,000.

354
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Hey, that looks pretty good.

355
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,400
This might be our bottom.

356
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,740
I might up my DCA instead once I've reached this accumulation zone so that instead of

357
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,620
buying $5 every day, I'm buying $7 or $10 because you will buy more Sats with your money

358
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:07,140
during that zone, and in the end, you will end up with more satoshis and more Bitcoin.

359
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,300
And that, in my frame of mind, is the goal.

360
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,620
Now, will this ever end?

361
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,040
That's a good question.

362
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,900
We don't know.

363
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,020
This may go from now until 2140.

364
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,580
There may be a four-year cycle as Bitcoin reduces supply every four years.

365
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,240
It is certainly possible.

366
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,280
There was a theory called the super cycle theory floating around during the last bull

367
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,100
run that basically said the four-year cycle is dead and we're going to go past.

368
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,340
We're not going to go down.

369
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,100
There's too much going on and so on and so forth.

370
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,380
And to an extent, to be honest, I bought into it and I should not have, and I kind of kicked

371
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,380
myself that I did.

372
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:05,140
But I would say until proven otherwise, I would continue to use this as guidance.

373
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,380
So one of the things that I'm going to do over the coming weeks is I'm going to chart

374
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:18,060
out for the next few years, like I said, maybe this 2025 date, and until I'm proven otherwise,

375
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,940
when we get to that fourth quarter of 2025, where it should be, according to the four-year

376
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:31,980
cycle, the all-time high, and in 2026, first quarter and we're higher, and then in the

377
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,420
second quarter, we're higher, I'm going to be going at that point, well, maybe the four-year

378
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,600
cycle is broken.

379
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,700
But until that happens, I will not believe it anymore.

380
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:51,140
So three times, three halvings in these three, four-year cycles does not make a law, if you

381
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,460
want to call it that.

382
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,420
But it's strong evidence that something might be going on here.

383
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,420
Does that make sense?

384
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,220
I don't want you betting the farm on this, and I don't want you, I don't even want you

385
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,460
speculating on this.

386
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,620
I just want you to view this as a useful tool, as a way to, to what?

387
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:15,220
Stack more Sats, stack sackers, right?

388
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Every start of the episode, what do I say?

389
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,700
I want you Sats, stackers, welcome sats, stackers, whatever it is that I say.

390
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,060
I want you stacking Sats, and I want you to do it in the most efficient way that you're

391
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,100
not having to stare at a chart every day and say, wow, it's up, you know, this little bit.

392
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,540
So I'll wait till it pulls back and that doesn't work real well.

393
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,260
But if you zoom out, if we look at the longer term, I think we will find that there are

394
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,260
more efficient places.

395
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,020
And again, I'm not saying you need to stop DCAing.

396
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
I believe in DCAing.

397
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,100
If nothing else, you should be DCAing.

398
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,980
If you do not understand what I'm saying after doing this and looking at these charts, then

399
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,180
just continue to DCA.

400
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,840
Don't worry about it.

401
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,420
If you do that long enough, Bitcoin has a 10 year, no longer than that.

402
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,700
How long has Bitcoin been around?

403
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,700
13 years, 14 years track record of going up.

404
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,820
And I would continue to believe that.

405
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:28,140
If Bitcoin ever goes to zero, then it's probably because the world has turned into a place

406
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,860
that, frankly, I don't even want to talk about.

407
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,060
So I'm going to continue to stack Sats.

408
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
I'm going to.

409
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:41,860
So I hope that makes sense.

410
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:48,540
Anyways, if you look at this chart, there's about an 18 month period, not really two years.

411
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,940
It is a two year, you can.

412
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,580
It makes sense to talk about kind of a two year up and a two year down.

413
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:01,060
But there is an 18 month period that ends about two months after the halving.

414
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,980
That's the best time to accumulate.

415
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,820
And what that means is actually between now and July of 2024 is the best time for accumulation.

416
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,460
It started a few months ago.

417
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,340
I would argue it started when we hit that low, right?

418
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:24,620
Whenever that was, I keep forgetting, middle of November, November the 20th of last year.

419
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:31,940
And it will go out for about 18 months until a couple of months after the next halving.

420
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,940
And you can look at the data from the last halving and the halving, it's the same.

421
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
Prices aren't the same.

422
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,860
Accumulations on that 18 month time period is as accurate as you're going to be able

423
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,380
to get until it changes, if it ever does.

424
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,740
So there you go.

425
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,220
I'm not predicting the price.

426
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,900
I'm not telling you Bitcoin is going to get to 100,000.

427
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,180
It's going to get to 250.

428
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,220
It's going to get to a million dollars in the next 90 days.

429
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:06,260
Like that person on Twitter is saying, because of our country going to doing everything they

430
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:11,020
can to mess up the economy and we'll talk about that in the news in just a second.

431
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:16,060
But that's just, it just is, that's just the best time to accumulate.

432
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,900
So keep that in mind.

433
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
Whatever I'm not going to tell you what to do.

434
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,380
Maybe you double your DCA, whatever you do, that is up to you.

435
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,940
But this is the time to be accumulating.

436
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,940
And don't let anybody talk you into anything different.

437
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,900
Don't, don't, I've been very careful.

438
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:42,180
I've said, even when I've talked about, I thought it would go lower than 15,000 or whatever.

439
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,540
I thought it, I thought it would get down to 12,000.

440
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,660
I was reasonably close, but still I'm over here saying 12,000.

441
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,100
Don't let people talk you into, well, it's going to get down to X, whatever X is, 12,

442
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,660
10, 5, 1,000.

443
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Don't do that.

444
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,740
Look at the overall picture.

445
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,180
Maybe it gets down there.

446
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Maybe it doesn't.

447
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,420
I hope I've been very clear saying you should DCA.

448
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,540
I also have said if it gets down to that point, I'm going to take everything I can and, and

449
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,340
shove it into Bitcoin at that point, because I don't think it's going to get any lower.

450
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,980
Well, I guess you could argue I missed that bet, except I've still got a window between

451
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:33,460
now and July of 2024 to keep accumulating, to keep putting Bitcoin miners on.

452
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:42,300
By the way, you can, I believe, see the same cycle in Bitcoin mining.

453
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,700
When Bitcoin is $69,000 like it was at the last all time high, what did we see?

454
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:57,700
We saw mining prices that were just off the charts.

455
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,180
So you could certainly make the argument that kind of the mining prices, it's a good time

456
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,180
to accumulate if you're buying miners, right?

457
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:13,500
After the halving, at least shortly after the halving, not a good time to accumulate.

458
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,060
Prices will be going up.

459
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,060
I don't know why they do it.

460
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,140
It's supply and demand, I guess, because as price goes up, everybody's like, oh, I want

461
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
to mine.

462
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,100
Nobody wants to mine when it's not profitable.

463
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,940
They want to mine, or perceived as not profitable, and I guess you could say it isn't, but my

464
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,780
miners are in place and they're mining and they're stacking SATs so that when we pass

465
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,780
that all time high next time, my miners are already there.

466
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,340
You see what I'm saying?

467
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,020
I'm already stacking SATs that are going up in price.

468
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:53,580
I won't be buying miners when the Bitcoin price is at the top.

469
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,780
I'll buy them just like I did when it's near the bottom.

470
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Does that make sense?

471
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,320
I believe it probably does.

472
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,180
If you followed the other four-year cycle, then this is just, it's very much the same

473
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,500
thing.

474
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,900
So again, I don't want to turn this into a mining podcast, but if you were thinking about

475
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:25,220
doing that between now and July 2024, it's probably the best time to do that.

476
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:31,180
And if you know that you're going to do it, I would encourage you, you know, Bitcoin may

477
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:39,220
be, we may already be near all time highs at 2024, July, and subsequently prices are

478
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,340
already higher for mining equipment.

479
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,740
I've watched, I bought mine very near the low, I think.

480
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,660
I've already watched prices creep up on them, at least on Kaboom Racks Marketplace.

481
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:01,460
Granted, that's a single place, but it's also fairly busy.

482
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,600
And I think they have a fairly accurate view of the market.

483
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:14,080
So I've watched the prices go up on my particular miner, about a hundred dollars.

484
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,600
So you do see that as time goes by and Bitcoin price rises, the miners get more expensive

485
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,480
as well.

486
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,280
So again, I'm not trying to predict the price.

487
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
I'm just trying to show you a pattern.

488
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,240
Pattern recognition is very important if you're trying to figure this stuff out.

489
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,680
And this is a definite pattern.

490
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,040
Now, will it remain forever?

491
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,080
I don't know.

492
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:47,400
And by the way, on that higher timeframe, probably of at least weekly, you can combine

493
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,720
that with other indicators.

494
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,600
I saw, in fact, I think it's one of these charts I'm posting, there's an RSI indicator

495
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,400
showing the exact same pattern.

496
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,040
It's crazy.

497
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,520
You got the highs at the top, you got the lows at the bottom, you got, it's, I don't

498
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,560
I know a lot of y'all don't necessarily believe in all these indicators and whatever.

499
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,280
And I will say that sometimes it can be very difficult to understand.

500
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,540
The problem is it's not a hundred percent, it's just not.

501
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,080
You can say, well, 66% of the time it's going to break up versus down here.

502
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,760
So it's messy, if you want to call it that anyways.

503
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,680
I think if you look at this overall view, you will find a very clear pattern that you

504
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,880
can use really in a very, you can just jot down some dates.

505
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
Hey, I'm going to buy my Bitcoin between here and here.

506
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:49,040
I already said, according to what I'm seeing, do your own research, look at the chart.

507
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,080
Between now and July of 2024 is going to be your best accumulation period.

508
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:02,280
And I did not realize actually, to be honest, I knew just because I've been around long

509
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,800
enough that the time period up to the halving, I actually figured out I'll kind of do this

510
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,320
more up to that maybe a month or two before that halving.

511
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,640
This actually shows that really it actually goes a couple months afterwards.

512
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,760
There's very clear data there to show to back that up.

513
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,280
So I would not discount that.

514
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,920
All right.

515
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,040
So let's talk about our supporters that time.

516
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,000
Berno, I want to give you credit, brother or sister.

517
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,880
I have no idea.

518
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,000
He sent in, they sent in, they sent in a 100 sat boost and said, keep on McIntosh the

519
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,800
way it's paved.

520
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:58,000
This was talking about Ceceo plebes stopped using their system last week's podcast, which

521
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,760
I feel like, quite honestly, is one of the most important ones that I've ever recorded.

522
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,400
I try not to be dramatic.

523
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,920
I try not to deal in hyperbole.

524
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,400
And you may view what I said last week as hyperbole.

525
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,160
I do believe it.

526
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,280
I do not know the timeframe, although sometimes I wonder if it's not going to be sooner rather

527
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
than later.

528
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
It may be 10 years.

529
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,360
It may be 20 years.

530
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,880
It may be my children's lifetime.

531
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,640
I may never even see it.

532
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,720
But I look at the data and I don't understand how else it's coming.

533
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:43,160
And I continue to see the governmental, I don't even want to say regulations, but you

534
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,000
know, the governmental situation that in my opinion, regardless of whether they're Democrat

535
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,120
or Republican here in our country, conservative or liberal, if you want to put it that way,

536
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,800
it doesn't seem to matter.

537
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,720
So that's just my opinion.

538
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,440
If you missed that, I would encourage you to go back and listen to it.

539
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,720
And I hope it at least is food for thought.

540
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,120
So I don't know.

541
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,560
But Berno was our supporter for the week.

542
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,360
I appreciate that, Berno.

543
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,560
And so now we will go into our news.

544
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,320
Of course, you can follow me on Twitter at McIntoshFintech, on Twitter.

545
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:38,840
I am on Mastodon at macintoshpodcastindex.social.

546
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,160
I'm also on Noster.

547
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,440
My pubkey is on my Twitter account because it's not an easy, you just need to go copy

548
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,360
it if you're experimenting with Noster.

549
00:47:50,360 --> 00:48:00,800
On March the 17th, actually, I missed this last week, but they, the Fed, the Federal

550
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,120
Reserve in one week, in one week, reversed roughly half of all the quantitative tightening

551
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,200
it accomplished over the prior year.

552
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,920
That's how quickly this can change.

553
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,480
So quantitative tightening is when they basically tighten up the money supply, they don't spend

554
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,320
so much, they buy back some of their debt, whatever.

555
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,280
Quantitative easing is the exact opposite.

556
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,840
And because of these banking failures that we have seen and are continuing to see, and

557
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:37,120
we will see down the road, they are starting to spend money again.

558
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,360
Like those drunken sailors that I mentioned last week, and I kind of want to quit making

559
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:48,360
that analogy because the drunken sailors stopped spending money when they ran out of money

560
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,120
and ran out of credit card.

561
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,800
The Fed doesn't have to do that.

562
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,000
So they are printing money for bailouts.

563
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
Inflation is still hot.

564
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:12,160
In fact, this week we saw a 0.25 percent raise in our inflation or our interest rate for

565
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,560
central banks here in the United States.

566
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,800
It's a situation that I think will not end well.

567
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,000
One of the things that Janet Yellen goes back and forth on is if they're going to actually

568
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,320
protect all the banks.

569
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,040
So I posted about this last week, if I'm not mistaken.

570
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:42,720
One of the representatives or senators from Oklahoma asked her directly, well, what about

571
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
my bank?

572
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:50,420
What about the community bank here in rural Oklahoma that's not Bank of America or JPMorgan

573
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:56,680
that you have said we will not allow to fail because there's too much systemic risk?

574
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,760
Well, what about the credit union on the street corner?

575
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,200
And at one point she said, well, in a political way, she said, we're not going to we're not

576
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
going to do that.

577
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,160
We'll do the FDIC limit and that's it.

578
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:17,520
If you have more than 250,000, I was mistaken last week, I said 100,000, 250,000 in your

579
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,640
account, then that's just lost.

580
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,280
Now she's come back probably because of the backlash on that says, well, we'll think about

581
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,680
that, you know, they'll do it until they run out of money.

582
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,560
I just don't know which is going to happen first or we're going to run out of money.

583
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,700
Are the banks going to stop failing or are what's going to happen?

584
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,120
And by the way, I don't want to go too deep into why these banks are failing.

585
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,400
There's other podcasts who are doing a good job of that.

586
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,360
It's kind of outside the scope, but the banks have been forced essentially into buying bonds

587
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,600
from the US government in larger amounts because supposedly these were a safe investment.

588
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:07,800
In fact, people will say, well, that's the safest form of investment that you can make.

589
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:14,400
And then the interest rates spiked up unexpectedly, quote unexpectedly.

590
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:23,040
We've raised interest rates because of inflation more in the last year or so than we ever have

591
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,920
if I'm not mistaken.

592
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,760
And actually that inverted the yield was what they call it on the bonds.

593
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,360
And that actually meant if a bank needed to sell those for whatever reason, they were

594
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,680
worth less than they bought them for.

595
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,820
And we're talking about billions of dollars in some cases.

596
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:45,180
That's actually what happened with Silicon Valley Bank.

597
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:53,000
They were forced to sell bonds and then they told people that they sold those bonds and

598
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,880
that actually started their bank run.

599
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:02,960
So people started withdrawing money, but they were down significantly because of that sale.

600
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,400
It's kind of like buying Bitcoin at 69,000 and selling at 15,000, right?

601
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,760
That's not what you want to do, obviously.

602
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,760
You're losing money when you do that.

603
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,480
And that's essentially what they did.

604
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,020
But the Federal Reserve or the federal government actually made them do that.

605
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,560
They made them buy those bonds.

606
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:28,000
They said as part of the Frank's Dodd Act, Dodd's, Frank, whatever, the big Bitcoin,

607
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:37,040
the big banking regulation act that came after our big crisis in 2008 or so, that was the

608
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
outcome of that.

609
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,440
They said, well, you got to invest more in treasury bills, T-bills.

610
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,640
And they did that.

611
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:51,080
And then they get in trouble because of the shenanigans of the last year or so.

612
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,780
That's all I'm going to go into about that.

613
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,560
If you want to understand more, what is that podcast I listened to?

614
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,200
It's actually what I've listened to for a bit.

615
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,720
He goes into some stuff that, you know, you may not be interested in, but specifically,

616
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,240
of course, lately he's been talking about this.

617
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,640
It's the Eurodollar University, I think is what it's called podcast.

618
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,080
And I know that they've done a pretty good coverage of this.

619
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,520
It's right up their alley.

620
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,840
They never talk about Bitcoin.

621
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,280
They talk about traditional economics.

622
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
So there you go.

623
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,700
Texas, the great state of Texas, and no, I do not live there, but Texas introduced a

624
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:36,040
bill to boost the local Bitcoin economy, protect the rights of holders, miners and developers.

625
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:42,720
So their state legislation passed a bill protecting people who code Bitcoin.

626
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,920
So core developers, that kind of thing, who mine Bitcoin and who own Bitcoin, which is

627
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,160
a very good thing.

628
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,760
We're starting to see other states.

629
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,360
Missouri had something like this.

630
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,160
I think Wyoming did as well.

631
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,680
I talk about these as they come up because states rights and what people can do in that

632
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,840
state in the United States, I can't speak for other countries.

633
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,720
They're not the same as us.

634
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,000
But these are very important as Bitcoin continues to grow.

635
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,760
And as the government, we will see continues, in my opinion, to tighten down its view on

636
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,360
cryptocurrency in general, fortunately, not Bitcoin specific.

637
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,280
Russia is going to use the Chinese Yuan instead of the US dollar to settle trades with Asia,

638
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,920
Africa and Latin America.

639
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,820
That is actually a really big deal.

640
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:34,760
That is the continued demonetization of the US dollar as the global reserve, and we will

641
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,080
lose benefits as the US because of that.

642
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,320
I've talked about that a number of times.

643
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,960
Just another step in that.

644
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,560
By the way, the Federal Reserve is launching what they call the FedNow service in July.

645
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:59,440
And that will be, in my opinion, a precursor to a central bank digital currency by the

646
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
United States.

647
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,400
Now, the government itself would say that's not true.

648
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,000
We will see.

649
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We will see.

650
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,560
I think it's more important in these times than ever before that you own your own Bitcoin,

651
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:20,920
not on an exchange, not your keys, not your Bitcoin, not your SATs.

652
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,760
That just doesn't flow quite so well.

653
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:33,880
The President Biden, his administration published a report, the economic report of the president.

654
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:41,520
And in fact, when they should have been worried about the actual economy of the United States,

655
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,360
they took this opportunity to attack Bitcoin, attack proof of work mining, and promote a

656
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,320
central bank digital currency.

657
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,880
It is almost a scary read.

658
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:00,360
I did not think that this type of legislation, well, this is not legislation, regulation

659
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,960
would be coming to the United States anytime soon.

660
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,960
I may be mistaken, I may unfortunately have to walk those words back if I ever actually

661
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,440
did say them.

662
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,480
I knew I actually said this was going to be a year of regulation, but not like this.

663
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,920
That's not really what I meant.

664
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,880
I meant more along the lines of what we're going to talk about with the SEC in just a

665
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,560
few minutes.

666
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:31,520
But if the White House comes out and if they start getting bipartisan support in Congress

667
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:39,480
to pass legislation to say, I don't know, proof of work mining with Bitcoin is not okay.

668
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,680
You can't do that in the boundaries of the United States.

669
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,720
I think that would be a huge blow to me personally.

670
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,600
I think Bitcoin would survive.

671
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,600
It's not a good report.

672
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:56,120
I don't think it's well written, but you could call me biased.

673
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,560
Janet Yellen, Treasury Secretary, she says the economy is performing well amidst the

674
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,280
current banking crisis.

675
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,640
I think Ms. Yellen needs to look around.

676
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,360
I think a few people, maybe a lot of people in government need to look around.

677
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,040
If you had any thoughts about where we go with this banking crisis and kind of where

678
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,240
it works into overall things, I thought this was a pretty good summary.

679
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,280
There are three scenarios for the ongoing bank crisis and Bitcoin.

680
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,040
A small chance of hyperinflation.

681
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,160
There is a non-zero chance of hyperinflation in my opinion.

682
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,080
I doubt it will happen.

683
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,680
Not yet.

684
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,560
I also think that's the worst case scenario.

685
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,520
The Federal Reserve is going to print a lot of money and get the banking crisis under

686
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
control.

687
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,640
We get high inflation, but not hyperinflation.

688
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,040
This is the most likely outcome.

689
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,040
I do agree.

690
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,200
I think that's exactly what will happen.

691
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,000
I think we have not seen the last of our banks fail.

692
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,560
I think we will see some centralization, so to speak, of banks because what happens is

693
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,520
bigger banks buy little banks as they fail.

694
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,120
That's just the way that it goes.

695
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,760
And I do believe we will end up with even higher inflation.

696
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,240
I do not think we've seen the top yet, even though others do.

697
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,040
That would also give us a good chance to continue Bitcoin adoption, which I think is what's

698
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,560
most important, especially because eventually I do think fiat will fail.

699
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,040
I think worldwide fiat will fail.

700
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,120
Maybe it doesn't all fail in the same year.

701
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,560
Maybe not even the same decade, but it will happen.

702
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,400
And having more and more Bitcoin adoption will only help that transition.

703
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,920
I don't ever want to diminish people getting hurt by the failures of fiat because it is

704
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:01,160
happening right now in third world countries because of Lebanon, 90% inflation, Argentina,

705
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,120
maybe arguably not a third world country.

706
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,120
I don't know.

707
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,200
I'm not sure how they're classified.

708
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,800
Regardless, over 100% inflation.

709
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:17,960
The people that it hurts the most are the people who are the least well off.

710
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:24,560
Regulators come down hard on Bitcoin and try and cut off on ramps and current trading,

711
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,800
which means a lot of turbulence for Bitcoin for some years.

712
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,640
I think that is likely.

713
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:42,000
I think of these three things, I think B, where they print a lot of money, is 60 to

714
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,240
70% likely.

715
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:57,400
I think C is 29 to 39% likely or something like that and a 1% chance of hyperinflation.

716
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,160
I think that could add up to 100, which was my goal.

717
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,760
All three Bitcoin will win.

718
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,920
It's a matter of who loses.

719
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,280
Bitcoin will win.

720
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,040
I don't care if the United States outlaws it.

721
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,680
China outlawed Bitcoin mining.

722
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,920
China outlawed people owning Bitcoin.

723
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,000
Did Bitcoin blink?

724
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,480
Hardly.

725
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:26,400
Our hash rate went down almost 50%, but within a couple of months, it had recovered.

726
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,960
Bitcoin doesn't actually care, by the way, whether you live in the United States, China,

727
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,600
Russia, El Salvador, Argentina, any country on earth.

728
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
It doesn't care.

729
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,880
It has no nationality, and that is one of the things I love about it.

730
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
All right.

731
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,880
I'll get off my rant.

732
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,880
Yep.

733
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,560
Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 bips.

734
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,280
I already said that, so now we're up to 5%, yay us.

735
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,120
And that is not inflation.

736
01:00:53,120 --> 01:01:00,400
That is our interest rates, but it is a precursor to inflation, almost certainly.

737
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,840
I'll skip that.

738
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,440
The Federal Reserve, the banking system in the United States is sound and resilient.

739
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,080
Well, okay.

740
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,640
We will keep reducing the balance sheet as planned.

741
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:24,360
This was on March the 22nd, and we know that in the week before that they raised the balance

742
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,760
sheets by a huge amount.

743
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,440
I mean, it's not inconsequential.

744
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,040
That's just flat lying to me.

745
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,600
I don't know what else to call it.

746
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,540
On March the 22nd, Janet Yellen said, we are not considering insuring all uninsured bank

747
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,320
deposits down.

748
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,560
I know she's flip-flop on this at least twice.

749
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,840
I don't know.

750
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,760
I don't know where they'll end up, and I don't think you should depend on that either.

751
01:01:52,760 --> 01:02:00,680
Coinbase, one of the oldest exchanges that there is.

752
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:07,760
March the 22nd, CEO of Coinbase tweeted, today, Coinbase received a Wells notice from the

753
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,720
SEC focused on staking an asset listings.

754
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,080
A Wells notice typically proceeds in enforcement action.

755
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:26,080
So the SEC is not required, by the way, to do this, but they typically do.

756
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,520
So what they've done is they've sent a letter saying, essentially, you're in violation of

757
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:38,160
SEC security laws, and it's around staking and it's around some of their assets.

758
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:44,720
I think Coinbase is going to be heavily fined, and I think that they're going to be required

759
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,400
to delist a large number of assets.

760
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,400
Time will tell.

761
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,760
I, of course, will follow this with great interest.

762
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,960
Again, as I've said in the past, the only crypto that I know of that is not a security

763
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,120
is Bitcoin.

764
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,120
Not even Ethereum.

765
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,560
They used to say Ethereum was not a security.

766
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:15,440
That is no longer held true to be true by the SEC, by the people at the SEC who speak

767
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,880
about these things, and I think the switch from proof of work to proof of stake was the

768
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,040
nail in the coffin for that.

769
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:28,440
So they fit every other criteria of being a security.

770
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,400
I'm actually not sure why they were never called a security before that, but that seemed

771
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,880
to be what tipped them off.

772
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,600
So that will be an interesting case to follow.

773
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,280
It will take a while, maybe.

774
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,800
It didn't take Kraken long to have to pay $30 million or whatever.

775
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:56,760
Okay, I posted on the 23rd just a little reminder, a dollar from two years ago is worth 87 cents

776
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,640
in buying power today.

777
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:05,000
If you saved $100,000 in cash from then till now, you lost $13,000 in purchasing power.

778
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,440
If you had a billion dollars in cash, you lost $130 million.

779
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,760
And I said banks are failing because of bonds, which is true.

780
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,280
And second, shrink inflation has become so common that people just expect it.

781
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,680
Governments are scrambling to find new forms of revenue.

782
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:30,840
This is the world fiat and Keynesian economies or economics have created.

783
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,000
And Bitcoin fixes this.

784
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,680
I posted that on the 23rd just a few days ago.

785
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,400
And you can verify all that if you would like.

786
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
That's fine.

787
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:48,120
When you go to a restaurant and your price of your meal stays the same, but your plate

788
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,560
size, your food, the amount of food that you get, gets smaller.

789
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,080
That's shrink inflation.

790
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:59,080
And that is not calculated into like CPI data.

791
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:06,000
So I believe inflation is actually higher than what's quoted at like 7% or so right

792
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
now.

793
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,640
I think it's actually significantly higher than that because these things are not taken

794
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
into account.

795
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:19,800
And another thing, they shifted the CPI data, for example, like a year or two ago, and they

796
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:26,920
don't take into account, well, maybe a family switches and this happens a lot.

797
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,640
Maybe they don't buy so much beef, which is more expensive.

798
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,240
They start buying more chicken.

799
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,860
Well, that's not inflation, not in their book.

800
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:41,200
The family is making choices to minimize their cost or really to keep their costs the same,

801
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,000
but they're buying different things.

802
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
See that doesn't strictly meet the definition of inflation, but it's part of it.

803
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,320
I'll say this in passing just because it's kind of important.

804
01:05:53,320 --> 01:06:02,840
The Terra Luna stablecoin, the Terra founder, Do Kwan, was arrested in Montenegro.

805
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Where is that?

806
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Italy?

807
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
France?

808
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Right there on the border maybe.

809
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
March 23rd.

810
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,360
He'll be going to jail for a while.

811
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,600
Strike launched payments, lightning payments in Vietnam.

812
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:26,600
German mining difficulty on March 23rd hit an all time high of 46.84 T. I'm not sure

813
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:33,120
what the T is, but an all time high difficulty, meaning it's more and more difficult to mine.

814
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,480
And that only happens ultimately as the price goes up.

815
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,080
Okay, I guess I wasn't quite done.

816
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,400
The U.S. banking turmoil can't be contained, Moody's warned.

817
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,400
Moody's is a very important company when it comes to banks.

818
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,560
They grade banks like an A plus or a B or whatever.

819
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,160
I believe I've mentioned them in passing at one point recently.

820
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,920
Well, they've now come out and said that all this stuff that's going on with the banks,

821
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
you can't contain it.

822
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,240
It's not done yet.

823
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:12,360
SEC warns that companies offering crypto asset investments or services may not be complying

824
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,520
with federal security law.

825
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,520
March 23rd.

826
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,720
I agree with, so I'm going to say something that may be controversial.

827
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,040
I agree with what the SEC is doing.

828
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:30,360
I believe, on the other hand, that they completely mishandled this up till this point.

829
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,600
I read what the Howey law is, the Howey test, excuse me.

830
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,720
I read what securities are.

831
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:44,760
I look at the definitions of 99% of these crypto assets and I believe that they fit.

832
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:51,120
There's security and the problem is when there's security, it gets much more difficult for

833
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,880
people to buy and sell them.

834
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,040
Plain and simple, Bitcoin is a commodity on the other hand.

835
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,360
Maybe someday we do a podcast about that.

836
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,040
If there's enough interest, I really don't want to go into it a whole lot.

837
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,360
I've settled it in my mind.

838
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,480
What I don't like is that the SEC seems to be all of a sudden coming down on all these

839
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,040
companies and everybody's running around screaming, well, the SEC is bad.

840
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:24,160
Well, the SEC is actually doing their job, but they should have been doing their job

841
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,040
since day one.

842
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:33,520
So crypto, basically everything that followed Bitcoin has been around for a long time.

843
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,120
These are nothing new.

844
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,480
So where have they been this entire time?

845
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,240
Because we've seen very little action and now all of a sudden it seems like they're

846
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,040
turning the screws.

847
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,080
So again, I don't disagree with what they're doing.

848
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:56,640
I just, the timeframe is weird, if that makes sense.

849
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:04,760
March 24th, which was Friday, that's ominous.

850
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:11,000
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calls top U.S. financial regulators to an unscheduled

851
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,240
meeting that is closed to the public.

852
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,560
Deutsche Bank, which is a German bank, not doing so well.

853
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,960
Jim Cramer said they're doing great, so they're probably going to fail tomorrow.

854
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,400
And that's kind of it.

855
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,880
Oh, brand new.

856
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,880
An hour ago I posted this.

857
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:40,120
Biden's 2024 budget request calls for $4.7 trillion with a T, not billion, trillion dollars

858
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,280
in tax increases.

859
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,320
Increases.

860
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,360
So clown world continues.

861
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,960
This is why I have Bitcoin.

862
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,800
I have Bitcoin for a number of things.

863
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,040
I'll try and summarize them very quickly.

864
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,440
Maybe I should, you know what, I think just next week I'll just do a podcast on that because

865
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:07,560
you could take an entire podcast I've been yammering on for an hour and good Lord, 25

866
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,560
minutes.

867
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,560
I got to stop.

868
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,720
You're all going to shoot me.

869
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,080
I'll clip some of this out, so we'll make it a little shorter, but I really try and

870
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,880
keep it in an hour.

871
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,840
Obviously I've not done so well.

872
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,840
No bank failures, so to speak, this week, last week at this point.

873
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,000
I should say that I do probably expect one or two more next week.

874
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
We'll see.

875
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,040
I think there's some, they're trying to bail them out essentially before they actually

876
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,320
happen at this point.

877
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,920
So maybe that's actually what's really going on.

878
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,920
All right.

879
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,200
That's it.

880
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,040
Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2.0.

881
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,560
It's a value for value podcast with no sponsors, no advertising.

882
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,380
You can support the podcast in three ways, time, talent, and treasure.

883
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,600
If you want to support the podcast and has the time or talent, I could use some things

884
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,240
such as help with transactions.

885
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,260
By the way, I've got some good ideas about that.

886
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,620
If somebody's interested, I'm actually going to bring that in house.

887
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:14,340
They've made a version of whisper that kind of a CPU driven, so I don't have to stop.

888
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:23,100
I can stop using the GPU setup that I've been using should be cheaper and easier to control.

889
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:31,500
I've also been in the process of moving a bunch of websites from a centralized, like,

890
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:37,580
I don't know, one of these centralized WordPress sites to containers.

891
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,540
And so they're going to run on a VPS.

892
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,280
It'll actually make it a lot easier for me to manage.

893
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,460
As part of that, I'm going to take the Generation Bitcoin website.

894
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:52,180
I will initially transfer as a WordPress site simply to move it over, but then I will create

895
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,540
a website in Ghost, I believe.

896
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:59,380
Ghost.io, I think, is what it's called.

897
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,980
It's kind of a more modern open source content management system.

898
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:11,280
So we'll reimagine that site in Ghost, and hopefully that will improve things a little

899
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,380
bit.

900
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,380
So there's stuff.

901
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,380
There's stuff.

902
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,500
If you want to do stuff, I got stuff.

903
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,840
That would be a huge help.

904
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,120
Here's just what it sounds like.

905
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,840
If you find the content valuable, you can support the podcast by streaming Sats.

906
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,640
You can boost from a podcasting 2.0 app.

907
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,800
Those apps are available at newpodcastapps.com or, I believe at this point, podcastapps.com.

908
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,600
In fact, I'm sure it's available.

909
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,080
Either one of those.

910
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,400
I use Fountain.

911
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,080
I use, man, I draw this blank every week.

912
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,240
It's so embarrassing.

913
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,240
Podverse.

914
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,080
I always want to say pod something, and then I stumble.

915
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,320
I'm like, those are the two that I drive all the time.

916
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:04,320
Podverse has great live podcasting built in so that when the podcasting 2.0 guys fired

917
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:11,120
up on a Friday afternoon and record that podcast, I get to listen to it live.

918
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,120
So that's really cool.

919
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,840
With Fountain, you can actually earn Sats while you're listening.

920
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:23,200
You can, in both of them, you can boost your favorite podcaster you can stream.

921
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,360
So you should check them out.

922
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,720
Okay.

923
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,340
If you like the content, I would love it if you tell your friends.

924
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,880
You can do a review, spread the word, whatever.

925
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,520
Put it up on, I don't know, Stacker News, whatever.

926
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,000
I have no idea.

927
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,120
Just let people know about the podcast.

928
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,400
It's the best way for us to gain new listeners.

929
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Thanks for being here.

930
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,320
I hope this has been helpful.

931
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,160
I hope this is something you use in the long term.

932
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,440
I would take the time if I were you to draw this out.

933
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,480
If you don't have chart software, I use TradingView, as I've said in the past.

934
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,400
I'm now on the free version, so to speak, where I'm not paying for it every month.

935
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,360
And that limits the amount of time you can go back.

936
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,560
But you may have access to that or what you can draw it out on graph paper.

937
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,040
I mean, literally just chart the month, month by month.

938
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,060
It's not that many points of data and pin it to your wall.

939
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,160
Don't lose sight of that.

940
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:32,400
Don't lose sight of that 18 month accumulation window that I've talked about and keep that

941
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,400
in mind.

942
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,040
I've already gone through where you can reach me.
