In this year-end review episode, we take an honest look at our 2025 predictions and how they held up against reality. Bitcoin started the year around $94k with high expectations, hit $122k in October, but closed near $87k - not quite the moonshot we anticipated. The institutional adoption we were excited about brought mixed results, with Wall Street playing their own games rather than simply pumping the price.
We reflect on what went right and wrong this year - from the disappointing lack of meaningful progress on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the continued regulatory challenges in Europe. Despite missing our price targets, the fundamentals remain strong and adoption continues to grow.
