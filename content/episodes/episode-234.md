In this Thanksgiving-themed episode, McIntosh and Kenshin discuss what they're thankful for regarding Bitcoin. They reflect on their gratitude lists from the previous year and share new perspectives, including appreciation for Bitcoin's educational value in economics, its ability to encourage long-term thinking, and the growing possibility of it becoming a neutral global reserve currency. They also discuss local Bitcoin meetups, recent market volatility showing over 8% of Bitcoin moving in the last seven days, and current price action following a significant draw down from October's all-time high. The hosts debate whether Bitcoin remains in a bull market or has entered a bear phase, with differing perspectives on what patterns suggest for the future.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “The Jetsons” by Joe Martin.
