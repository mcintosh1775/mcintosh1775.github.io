McIntosh:00:00:03Hey, Pleb Nation. Today is January 7th, and this is episode 150 of Satoshis Plebs. I'm your host, Macintosh, and today's episode is why privacy matters.

00:00:42Alright.

00:00:43Let's get on into it. I've been having some technical problems.

00:00:47Not sure what's going on. I had to turn off all of my effects

00:00:52In order not to sound like crap, it just was not working.

00:00:57I don't know. I'm in the process of transitioning to the new lap It's not a laptop. The new computer. I've not completed that yet. I have Reaper set up, but I thought I was having problems with that setup of Reaper, but it may actually just Reaper.

00:01:11I'm not sure what's going on,

00:01:14but we are not gonna let that slow us down, are we? So tonight, you get to hear my raw, unfiltered voice. I know you're excited about that,

00:01:22but,

00:01:25And, we will drink the Earl Gray, with our honey to help out our throat,

00:01:31and we will charge on. Let's do our market update. I am going to do everything in my power tonight to keep this down to about 30 minutes to 45

00:01:41at the most. I'm gonna

00:01:44Go through this, and then we're gonna jump right into

00:01:46tonight's

00:01:48topic, why privacy matters.

00:01:50I'm gonna talk about some things. Let's do it. Bitcoin price

00:01:54closed January 7th, just a few minutes ago. 6th well, no. It's Been almost 2 hour, no,  2 hours and 40 minutes ago.

00:02:03I got sidetracked.

00:02:0543,948

00:02:08Dollars and 71¢,

00:02:10which I do believe means we've had another weekly high. Let me double check that.

00:02:15No. We did not.

00:02:18So we had, I think, 8 weeks in a row,

00:02:23and then,

00:02:24Green, essentially, and then a down and then an up and then a down and then an up and then a down,

00:02:30but it wasn't by much. So,

00:02:32overall, we're still in really good shape. We're on top of that ascending try channel

00:02:39that we've been sitting on since,

00:02:41We got

00:02:42we actually entered the channel on December no. Good gracious, alive.

00:02:48Back in October,

00:02:49On the 23rd, we were in the channel. This is what I was thinking

00:02:53of. Until oh, let me go down to daily.

00:02:56I'm on the weekly chart.

00:02:59Excuse me for just a second.

00:03:02I like to be as accurate as possible. We exited that channel on December 2nd, and we have been essentially daily closing above it certainly

00:03:11since then.

00:03:13We'll be talking about in the news this week with Bitcoin

00:03:16ETFs, the so called spot ETFs,

00:03:20they are coming.

00:03:22We do look it does look like it will be this week that they will be approved,

00:03:26Probably Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. I thought they were gonna slip up and do it Friday, but they did not.

00:03:32They held off.

00:03:35But all the paperwork,

00:03:37at least, is what I understand is in place.

00:03:40The stamps are ready to be put down,

00:03:44And the companies such as BlackRock are ready to be notified

00:03:49that they can start selling

00:03:51Spot ETFs in very short order.

00:03:54So that's a

00:03:56sneak peek

00:03:57at the news, but let me stick to my hedge doc notes

00:04:03so I don't get off track. Our block height that time we're recording, 824,805

00:04:10difficulty adjustment

00:04:11It was down or right now, if we had it right now, it'd be down 12.3%.

00:04:18So that's pretty impressive,

00:04:20drop. We've been going up quite a bit, so it'd be a welcome drop that will happen on January 21st, which, of course, Means we just had 1 a couple of days ago,

00:04:31and that difficulty adjustment was up.

00:04:35And

00:04:36let me see. Come on, time change calendar.

00:04:411.65%

00:04:43just a couple days ago.

00:04:45So not a huge spike upward,

00:04:47but yeah.

00:04:49Right now, it's looking like we might have a downward adjustment. I'm hoping for at least half For that, would be nice.

00:04:55The fees in MN pool,

00:04:5748 sats per vbite right now, which is better than it's been for a while. I've seen it as low as, like, 33. I think that was last night.

00:05:06We still have 1.77

00:05:08gigabytes of unprocessed

00:05:10transactions, which is just

00:05:12Nuts.

00:05:14Okay. That's it. Market. Not gonna talk about it anymore,

00:05:19until we get to the news.

00:05:20I will talk about it a little bit more.

00:05:23I'll be honest.

00:05:24Alright. What are we talking about tonight?

00:05:27Why privacy matters?

00:05:29You guys know

00:05:30this has been stewing around with me for a while.

00:05:34This is nothing new, but we're gonna actually spend,

00:05:38I think 2 or 3 weeks talking about this. I am not gonna try and cram all this into 1 week. We're gonna kinda do some background today. And in the next episode, which should be Thursday,

00:05:48we'll start diving into some Bitcoin

00:05:51specific privacy techniques,

00:05:54and then we'll see if we need to do a 3rd episode.

00:05:58So why privacy matters? Why is privacy

00:06:01important? I'm going to talk to you from a

00:06:05US centric

00:06:06view as I always do because I

00:06:10Have lived virtually my entire life in the United States. I have not lived here my entire life, but most of it. The 4th amendment.

00:06:18This is an amendment to our constitution,

00:06:20which is supposed to be a guarantee

00:06:23of the rights of

00:06:25the United States

00:06:27citizen. The 4th Amendment specifically

00:06:30deals with privacy. There's other amendments that do to an Dent, but this is when they talk about the privacy amendment, this is it. The 4th amendment is very short. It's literally

00:06:42one sentence. It's a long one, but it's one sentence, and I'm gonna read it.

00:06:47The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,

00:06:51Papers and effects

00:06:53against unreasonable

00:06:54searches and seizures

00:06:57shall not be violated And no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause

00:07:03supported by oath and affirmation,

00:07:05and particularly

00:07:06describing the place to be searched And the persons or things to be seized.

00:07:12Okay? What does that mean? It means without a warrant, without a court order,

00:07:18You cannot go and search someone's house, their papers, their effects, their private

00:07:23property

00:07:24just because.

00:07:27We see this extend out

00:07:29in theory to

00:07:31when you're driving down the road, they can't just pull you over and search your vehicle

00:07:36because they think that you're a drug dealer because of the way that you look.

00:07:41I'm gonna leave it at that.

00:07:43I know that's not a complete picture of what's going on, but bear with me. So,

00:07:49McIntosh,

00:07:50that is the US View. What is the worldwide view? Well, that's going to depend on what country you live in. But I do understand

00:07:58I do understand

00:08:00that

00:08:01There is a document

00:08:04called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was published, I believe in the late 19 forties

00:08:10by the United Nations.

00:08:12In article 12, a right to privacy

00:08:15is expressly stated. What does that mean? Well, that means in theory,

00:08:20the UN buys into this idea that people should have privacy.

00:08:27We see in various countries around the world various levels of this in more

00:08:34Dictatorial

00:08:35comp countries,

00:08:37countries that are authoritarian,

00:08:40we see abuse of this. We see people with a lack of privacy.

00:08:45Why is this so important?

00:08:47It's important,

00:08:50for a lot of reasons, but

00:08:52you here's a common when you start talking about privacy, people will be like,

00:08:57Well, I'm not doing anything wrong, and I will be the 1st person to tell you to my knowledge,

00:09:03which

00:09:05I I have to preface that because with,

00:09:08say, our tax code

00:09:10or our regulations, our laws and regulations

00:09:13In the United States that we currently have, I

00:09:16could be violating

00:09:18a law and not even know it. But to my knowledge, I don't run around

00:09:23violating laws. I have nothing to hide, so to speak. I could be one of these people saying that, but I understand

00:09:30the importance of privacy.

00:09:32And we should not just give that

00:09:35up because, quote, you know, we're not doing anything wrong.

00:09:40Because there are places, and I have been to

00:09:44one of them at least,

00:09:46where

00:09:47That right is not guaranteed.

00:09:51And, subsequently,

00:09:52you have a government who's out of control,

00:09:55who does everything in his power

00:09:57to monitor the populace

00:10:00and tie everything to that. And I don't wanna dive into that too deeply,

00:10:06But let's just say that that is the case.

00:10:10And they will take things that

00:10:12you're not harming other people,

00:10:15And you're not hurting the government. You're not doing anything except minding your own business, but you're violating

00:10:22A rule of theirs, and therefore, they're going to come down on you

00:10:26very hard.

00:10:28And you may lose

00:10:30Financial privileges, you may lose,

00:10:35family access. You may be put in prison.

00:10:39And this is not a joke.

00:10:42So

00:10:43these things are important.

00:10:46Your employer

00:10:48shouldn't be able to see where you spend your paycheck. It's not their business.

00:10:53The convenience store that I go to To make a small purchase from,

00:10:58maybe

00:11:00a Coke

00:11:01or candy bar, I know I shouldn't be eating those things, but let's be

00:11:07They shouldn't see how much money I have, how much money I control,

00:11:11and where else I go to make purchases.

00:11:15These are just 2 simple examples.

00:11:19My neighbors don't need to know my financial matters.

00:11:24My friends don't and I love my friends, but they don't need to know my financial business unless I

00:11:32reveal that to them,

00:11:34If I choose to do that

00:11:37by the way,

00:11:38we should probably actually define

00:11:42Privacy.

00:11:45Privacy is the degree that you have control over access to your information.

00:11:51No. I don't want my employer to know my financial business

00:11:55outside of they pay me a certain amount of money to work for them a certain amount of time, and and that's it. That is that is the extent of the contract that we have made.

00:12:05I don't want the convenience store to know everything that I've ever done.

00:12:11That's privacy.

00:12:13I can reveal

00:12:16that.

00:12:16It doesn't mean it's a black hole and you can't ever

00:12:20See that. I can choose to allow that to happen,

00:12:24but I have the right

00:12:26to the privacy,

00:12:28to the ability to block that.

00:12:31We get this confused, especially in kind of crypto or Bitcoin circles as we talk about here,

00:12:37with anonymity.

00:12:40Anonymity

00:12:41is just

00:12:43the lack of a link between a transaction

00:12:47and your personal

00:12:49identity.

00:12:50So I'm anonymous

00:12:52if you don't know who I really am. And as y'all know,

00:12:55I

00:12:56Use a pseudonym,

00:12:58Macintosh. That's not my real name. In no part is that my real name. You cannot Google Macintosh and find a picture of me. You find a picture of my ancestor, which I've talked about before.

00:13:10He was a Creek Indian chief,

00:13:13pretty famous around 18/12.

00:13:16Okay?

00:13:17He was one of my ancestors, but

00:13:20I just chose that name because I knew who he was, I knew what he had done, so on and so forth.

00:13:26And it's a way to for me to have anonymous

00:13:31actions.

00:13:32It's not privacy.

00:13:35It's private

00:13:36if the

00:13:382 parties who are involved,

00:13:40typically,

00:13:42are the only people who know about details. That's privacy. I'm giving you 1 Bitcoin.

00:13:50You know that I'm giving you that. I I know that I'm giving it to you and so on and so forth. That's it. But nobody else knows,

00:13:59Even the government,

00:14:01even the state,

00:14:03even

00:14:04your friends, your family, your Church,

00:14:08your employer,

00:14:09all of those things. Right?

00:14:12Alright.

00:14:13So Keep that in mind as we're talking about all this, and we are specifically talking about privacy.

00:14:20Anonymity is Often linked with that, but they are 2 slightly different things. I came up with what I call a privacy axiom. What is an axiom? An axiom was something I learned in mister Hollingsworth's

00:14:32geometry class.

00:14:34Way back in 9th grade, I was not a very good geometry student,

00:14:38but they had these Axioms and geometry.

00:14:43I don't know. All 3 angles, I think this is an axiom. I hope I'm not wrong. I didn't look it up.

00:14:49All 3 angles of a triangle

00:14:51have to add up to a 180

00:14:53degrees. I think you could call that an axiom.

00:14:57It is a provable

00:14:58truth.

00:14:59It is, in some cases, is what they call a self evident truth.

00:15:05That's another way of putting it. It's self evident. If I add up a 100 triangles

00:15:11that the inside angles are going to come out,

00:15:15to a 180 degrees. I think that's right. 60, 60, 60, 90.

00:15:20Yeah. 90, 45, 45.

00:15:23Yeah. 180.

00:15:24Right.

00:15:26You'd be proud of me, mister Hollingsworth, if you're still alive.

00:15:30Anyways,

00:15:33I have an axiom that I came up with, and I did make this up. I've never heard this before,

00:15:39at least in this form.

00:15:41Regardless

00:15:42of what amendments, laws, or articles,

00:15:45articles like this one about from the UN, are in place about privacy,

00:15:51Government surveillance

00:15:52will continue

00:15:53to increase

00:15:55over time.

00:15:56Think about that.

00:15:58Think about the amount of monitor okay. Just

00:16:02right here in the United States,

00:16:04just recently,

00:16:06It was beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is not a conspiracy theory uncovered that

00:16:12various

00:16:13Three letter organizations, I believe it was the FBI and maybe the CIA,

00:16:18but I don't wanna bet on that.

00:16:21We're involved with

00:16:22Facebook.

00:16:24Facebook? No. Twitter.

00:16:26Sorry.

00:16:27Or maybe it

00:16:29now I'm not even sure. I really should look this up. Regardless, they were monitoring customer traffic right in the building.

00:16:37No privacy.

00:16:38Now Twitter, you can say, well, that's

00:16:41a public service or whatever, but this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. They would have had access to details

00:16:48that They should not have,

00:16:50and they were kicked out. They were removed. Now did, you know, Washington DC burned down? No.

00:16:58I'll give you another example.

00:17:00I was just reading about this last night. I think I included this in the show notes.

00:17:05So and I'd heard about this before, but there's a case going on. This is crazy. I believe this is kind of a worldwide

00:17:13idea, but Here at least here in the United States, we have these things called safety deposit or safe deposit boxes.

00:17:20When Maybe I've got some valuable papers, some

00:17:25coinage,

00:17:26maybe some jewelry, this kind of thing. I don't wanna keep it at my house.

00:17:32I

00:17:33go to a bank or

00:17:36a business whose that's all they do, and it goes into a safe

00:17:40deposit box. Now that is

00:17:42my property. It is going into this company whose their job is to

00:17:48manage That privacy

00:17:50for me. There's a company in California. It's true story. I think it's in Los Angeles, but I do know it's in California.

00:17:57They went,

00:17:59excuse me. The FBI

00:18:01went in

00:18:03with some

00:18:05warrant

00:18:06To get at

00:18:08the business's

00:18:11papers.

00:18:12The business was under investigation.

00:18:14This is Very important to understand.

00:18:17You've got the business. You got the safety deposit boxes of the customers.

00:18:23They went in

00:18:25and grabbed

00:18:26all of the safety deposit boxes

00:18:29or safe deposit boxes, took them,

00:18:32Open them all up, cataloged everything in there, and then

00:18:37literally the things of value in there,

00:18:40they took out And they started basically trying to pull into custody

00:18:46in order to keep people from getting their stuff back. Now This is a complete invasion

00:18:52of privacy.

00:18:53I do not see how you

00:18:55reconcile that

00:18:57with the 4th Amendment, for example,

00:19:00And that is being worked out in our court system right now. That's why

00:19:04I

00:19:05even knew about this.

00:19:07But my point is,

00:19:10this is a fairly recent I I don't think you would have heard about this even

00:19:1520 years ago.

00:19:17Now maybe it did happen. Maybe I'm being naive.

00:19:20But it certainly become easier for governments to monitor data, for governments to monitor Internet traffic,

00:19:27bank transactions, and all this kind of stuff. And the Bank Secrecy Act don't even get me started.

00:19:34Y'all have heard me talk about this before.

00:19:37What is it? Less than $10,000,

00:19:41and

00:19:42The bank is basically going to be forced to ask you some questions about what you're doing with your money. With your money.

00:19:50Well, I'm sending it to my grandpa because he needs it to stay in the old folks' home. It's none of your business.

00:19:57That Started in, I believe the 19 seventies

00:20:01in some form.

00:20:03I used to I did know at one point the actual time that

00:20:08started. But regardless,

00:20:10this is just another example of government overreach.

00:20:15Where is all this going, Macintosh?

00:20:17To me,

00:20:20Bitcoin has

00:20:222 primary functions.

00:20:24Too.

00:20:26Anything else?

00:20:28It's

00:20:30a store of value,

00:20:32which we'll be discussing shortly

00:20:35in the news.

00:20:37And it's an so it's an investment,

00:20:40and it's a currency.

00:20:42When I use it

00:20:44as either one of those things,

00:20:47let's

00:20:48flip the tables here for just a second. Let's not talk about Bitcoin.

00:20:53Gold

00:20:54no longer really uses currency,

00:20:57still used by a lot of people

00:21:00As a story value.

00:21:02If I own a block of gold,

00:21:05is it the government's business that I own that block of gold? No. Not really.

00:21:10If I choose to take that block of gold and put it into

00:21:14some financial

00:21:15instrument,

00:21:16that's probably going to mean that there's Some level

00:21:20of privacy that I lose, but I have the ability to keep that gold all by itself

00:21:26in my house in,

00:21:30Say, a safe

00:21:31under lock and key. I don't have to tell anybody about it,

00:21:35and it's my store of value.

00:21:38So that's one of Bitcoin's primary functions.

00:21:41And I want the ability to have that

00:21:45with as much privacy as possible.

00:21:48How do you do that? Well, it's no KYC.

00:21:52You don't buy it or exchange.

00:21:55You don't I don't know.

00:21:58Offhand, I I I I could

00:22:00that would basically be it. And you will store it in your own self custody on a hardware wallet like a seed sign or this kind of thing.

00:22:07So certainly, theoretically and practically, you can do that. It's difficult to buy without kyc. That's

00:22:15the snag.

00:22:16My suggestion would be to talk to people at your Bitcoin

00:22:20meetup.

00:22:21You may be able to buy from somebody there.

00:22:24You still need to be careful.

00:22:27But we're going to be talking about that more over coming weeks. So I don't want to get too deep into that.

00:22:33Bitcoin is a currency.

00:22:36Again, second use case,

00:22:38There are a lot of places

00:22:41where

00:22:42buying certain things, doing certain things, making certain financial transactions

00:22:47Can get you in trouble.

00:22:49I will leave it up to you to

00:22:52figure out, are these things

00:22:56Important for you.

00:22:58I'm not going to tell you what you should be doing with your money.

00:23:03What I do wanna do is make it as private as possible because we do not know what's coming down the road.

00:23:12You know, when Russia invaded Ukraine,

00:23:15I said and the United States cut off The Russia from the SWIFT network, and make no mistake, that's where it came from. I said that's a bad move. Is Russia wrong to invade

00:23:26the Ukraine?

00:23:28From my perception,

00:23:29absolutely,

00:23:31and it still is.

00:23:33That has not changed. But

00:23:35When you start messing with people's

00:23:38money,

00:23:39and that's what that was doing,

00:23:42that to me is like a sacred

00:23:44thing.

00:23:45If I'm stopping the average person in Russia who may or may not agree

00:23:50with what the Kremlin,

00:23:53Is it the I think it's the Kremlin.

00:23:57Does. Then

00:23:58I

00:23:59that's a problem.

00:24:02And when we shut off the SWIFT network to Russia, that caused problems for the average Russian

00:24:10person.

00:24:13What if you go to

00:24:16see, I'll think I pick on different

00:24:18countries. I don't.

00:24:22Let's go to Canada.

00:24:23Canada's

00:24:24fairly

00:24:25safe.

00:24:29The truckers strike that happened during COVID. I do not know if you agree with that or not. There's certainly a lot of division about that. Whatever.

00:24:38But you had people protesting

00:24:40in Ottawa,

00:24:42truckers,

00:24:42because they felt like they couldn't do their job.

00:24:46And what did the government do?

00:24:49If they can figure out who they were, they cut off access to their bank accounts.

00:24:55That's not right. That's not okay.

00:24:58You there's no

00:25:01there was no trial. There was no justice. There was no legal process. There was nothing. There was a court order that the

00:25:10government managed to get,

00:25:12And they shut down their bank account. They froze them.

00:25:15That's not okay.

00:25:16You may or may not agree with the truckers.

00:25:20It's not okay to block access to their money. Money

00:25:25is something that everyone needs.

00:25:28And before we

00:25:31presume

00:25:32guilt, which was another

00:25:34amendment, I think, it's certainly in the constitution

00:25:37in whole,

00:25:38You

00:25:39you we have a right not to be presumed guilty, essentially. You have to prove somebody does something in order to take their money, to take their property.

00:25:51That did not happen in this case. And it does not happen with these random Seizures, just like the FBI thing that I was talking about.

00:26:00The people who had

00:26:02cash,

00:26:03gold,

00:26:04jewelry,

00:26:05Other things like that in those safe deposit boxes,

00:26:10they were not given a trial. They never appeared before a judge. They There was no guilt on their part. This was not about them.

00:26:19This was some vacuous

00:26:22power grab by the FBI

00:26:25because they're trying to,

00:26:28as far as I can tell, just grab a bunch of stuff.

00:26:32So I want my money to be as private as possible.

00:26:36Let's talk about Bitcoin to wrap this up. I'm 30 minutes in. I Promise you I'm gonna be done in 45 minutes.

00:26:43In total,

00:26:46I'm I'm gonna stick to this this year. 30, 45 minute episodes. I'm gonna tighten it up.

00:26:52Bitcoin

00:26:54is as private as you want it to be. This is a perception. I wrote this straight off of

00:27:01Twitter.

00:27:02No. It's not. No. It's not. I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2013.

00:27:07When you say something like that, you presume that a person has the knowledge

00:27:13to buy it without fiat, Without

00:27:16sorry. Without going through an exchange,

00:27:19without

00:27:20maybe they mine it. Maybe they Buy it from somebody,

00:27:25at a Bitcoin,

00:27:27meetup.

00:27:27But you don't know who that person is, so maybe they're tracking you. I mean, it is Possible,

00:27:33and it has happened.

00:27:34Bitcoin

00:27:35by default is not private. And to be private, to have some level of privacy, and we're gonna be talking about The ways that we can do that over the next couple weeks

00:27:44and what I hope our future innovations

00:27:47in that,

00:27:49It takes technical knowledge at this point. It's not just point, click, tap, doop, bop, bop, and it costs Money

00:27:57in

00:27:58every case that I know of.

00:28:01It's not built,

00:28:04for the most part,

00:28:05into the protocol level

00:28:07of the Bitcoin main chain.

00:28:10So when people say things like that, and I copied that Right off the Twitter, Bitcoin is as private as you wanna be. No fiat, no KYC.

00:28:18That presumes

00:28:20I am a tech smart person

00:28:22with access

00:28:24to things that the average person

00:28:27out there, even in the United States, won't have much less

00:28:32A, quote, developing country

00:28:35who,

00:28:36you know,

00:28:37maybe they make $5 a day

00:28:40And any kind of fees on top of Bitcoin, if they're even able to do Bitcoin,

00:28:46are a no go.

00:28:48So one of the most misunderstood benefits of Bitcoin's blockchain, its main chain, is its pseudo anonymity.

00:28:55This is because,

00:28:57Like I said, we kind of use these terms anonymous and privacy,

00:29:02interchangeably.

00:29:03That's not really true.

00:29:06And it's really important when you're dealing with a Bitcoin transaction.

00:29:10Your transaction cannot be anonymous

00:29:13if it is linked To your personal identity. If you do anything

00:29:18through Coinbase, through Kraken,

00:29:20through any of these exchanges

00:29:22that you have to key in your personal identification

00:29:25or take a picture or whatever to prove that you are you.

00:29:30You're now linked to that.

00:29:32And it's only private if

00:29:35we can

00:29:36the 2 parties involved

00:29:38are the only people who have access to those details. The amount,

00:29:43where it came from, where it's going, etcetera. And who's involved?

00:29:51Because of the nature of a blockchain,

00:29:55This so called ledger,

00:29:57this actually counteracts

00:30:00completely

00:30:01this concept of privacy.

00:30:03The ledger is publicly

00:30:05distributed

00:30:06data.

00:30:07The transactions

00:30:09between

00:30:102 or more

00:30:12parties

00:30:13with some level

00:30:14of anonymity.

00:30:16That anonymity

00:30:18is what Allows users to maintain some level of privacy while ensuring the ability to audit the 21,000,000

00:30:26in total Bitcoin. Of course, Not all those have been mined. You could argue they've not all been created,

00:30:31etcetera. So

00:30:33that's a problem.

00:30:35Let's see. We want privacy, at least I do.

00:30:39And I this is something I will argue about.

00:30:42But Bitcoin as a blockchain,

00:30:44as As

00:30:46a ledger of record

00:30:48directly opposes that. So how do we how do we get around that? Well, that's what we'll be talking about over the next couple of weeks. How can we do that?

00:30:59What are some things

00:31:00that can happen?

00:31:03Alright.

00:31:05News.

00:31:06Not a whole lot, but there were a few things.

00:31:10I I wanna talk about the ETFs. I'm also gonna talk about

00:31:14this news came out. I wanna go ahead and throw this out real quick, and then we'll dive into ETFs.

00:31:21Bitmain is the main number one

00:31:25immensely larger by volume

00:31:28Bitcoin miner out there. They're based in mainland China, if I'm not mistaken, in South China.

00:31:34And they're huge, like, Probably, I don't know, 90 plus percent of the miners out there are Bitmain.

00:31:42So it turns out and I don't know why this came up,

00:31:45but it

00:31:47did. Bring this up real quick.

00:31:50There was some oh, so Core Scientific

00:31:53Was a is a hosting company, a mining hosting company. They mine. They also

00:31:58they also host other people's miners. They're in bankruptcy or

00:32:03some state of bankruptcy.

00:32:04And because of that, they're dealing with the court. They had actually received court approval

00:32:10to purchase, and I heard a guy on a mining podcast this week talking about this. They're purchasing

00:32:1827,000

00:32:19s nineteen j x piece from Bitmain,

00:32:23and, and here's the punchline.

00:32:26And they're going to host an additional 27,000

00:32:31s nineteen j x piece

00:32:33for the Chinese mining

00:32:35manufacturer.

00:32:37There's kind of been rumors about this, but this is definitive. This is a legal document.

00:32:43Core Scientific is hosting

00:32:46or will host

00:32:4727,000

00:32:49of the Bitmain miners

00:32:50for Bitmain. So Bitmain itself,

00:32:53the company,

00:32:54will be mining Bitcoin

00:32:56if they are not already. What does that mean?

00:33:01The company that most people purchase miners from is directly competing with the miners. The irony of this is just

00:33:09fantastic. Now

00:33:10My miners, they're all bit main. Why are they bit main? Well, they run well.

00:33:15They are cheaper than, say,

00:33:19The next one or any of them, really.

00:33:22And

00:33:23they're the most convenient to get.

00:33:26And So 9 tenths probably of the minors out there, like I said, are bit man. There's certainly a significant percentage, well over 50%.

00:33:35But this same company

00:33:37is

00:33:38basically competing against the people that they sell product to.

00:33:42It's crazy. I hope

00:33:45This either changes,

00:33:47I don't think it will,

00:33:49or people start migrating to other

00:33:53companies.

00:33:54I really would like to see more diversity in the Bitcoin mining space in terms of the hardware.

00:34:01I think we will slowly see that over the next few years, probably

00:34:055 plus years, 5 to 10 years.

00:34:07Anyways, that was some very interesting news for the miners out there.

00:34:12Let's talk about ETFs.

00:34:15There was so much news about the ETFs this week. Twitter was was all up and

00:34:21whatever because

00:34:23because

00:34:24They thought that basically the approval was gonna come

00:34:28in the last couple of days, and it didn't happen.

00:34:32So I think we're looking at Monday,

00:34:34Tuesday, Wednesday, kind of the original time frame if y'all remember, 8 January 8 through 10

00:34:41Based on when the filing started,

00:34:45to see this, and I do think they'll be approved. And I think when that happens, we will see a lot of money

00:34:52flow into Bitcoin. I think a decent portion of it will happen immediately.

00:34:56It would not surprise me. So this is kind of the 2nd part of my market update. I think if that happens this week, we can have 1 or 2 things. If

00:35:06If the SEC,

00:35:07for whatever reason, comes out and says this is not happening anytime soon, that's gonna

00:35:13drop the market. It may drop 5, 10

00:35:16$1,000 wouldn't surprise me. People are so wound up about these ETFs. It'll bounce back, but I'm just saying it could happen.

00:35:25If it gets approved and there's in my mind, there's 95%

00:35:30chance of that happening,

00:35:32Then

00:35:33do we break 50,000?

00:35:35I'm fairly certain we will over the next, say, month. So say

00:35:40Let's say by the end of February.

00:35:42Could we break 60,000

00:35:44by the end of February?

00:35:46I believe we could.

00:35:47And I think what I predicted

00:35:50I'll have to go back and look at my notes.

00:35:53But I wrote it up in the notes for last episode.

00:35:56By the happening,

00:35:58so in April, I think we'll be above all time highs.

00:36:02I think

00:36:04Some of it will be the ETFs. Some of it will just be the general

00:36:07environment and what we see going on in Bitcoin and all this kind of stuff.

00:36:12I fully expect that. So you heard it first here, probably not, but, yeah, I think that's what's gonna happen. Now

00:36:20I've said this or I've tweeted this or whatever.

00:36:24Does Bitcoin need these ETFs? Absolutely

00:36:27not.

00:36:28We know do not.

00:36:30We do not 100% need these ETFs.

00:36:33What this will do, however,

00:36:35is start to open up the gates to the Wall Great money. It will start pouring in. These are big companies

00:36:42that we're talking about. BlackRock,

00:36:45Morgan Stanley,

00:36:46Fidelity.

00:36:48Van

00:36:49Eck.

00:36:50Van Eck, actually, in in another little bit of news. I thought this was really cool.

00:36:56And, well, we'll get to the cool part, and then we'll talk about what people are saying.

00:37:00They're saying that they're gonna donate

00:37:03a Pretty decent amount. 5 I think it was 5%

00:37:07of the fees that they collect

00:37:09to Bitcoin core development.

00:37:11So, basically, it will help out the Bitcoin court work that goes on that's so necessary.

00:37:17Now everybody's like, oh, well, they'll be in the pocket of Van Eck and blah blah blah.

00:37:22I suppose that's theoretically

00:37:25possible, but honestly, I don't think that's what's gonna happen.

00:37:29I really don't think that they're gonna sway

00:37:31any core developer to do something

00:37:34to benefit an ETF or anything like that. I don't even see how Possible.

00:37:39But I wouldn't completely write it off, but it

00:37:43kinda seems like a conspiracy

00:37:45theory to me. So,

00:37:48anyways, that was pretty cool.

00:37:50But everybody has updated

00:37:54They did their final documents. I think the vast majority of them have been updated. There's, like, a dozen companies involved at this point,

00:38:03And it's just about time. So Monday morning, they may approve all this, and you may see the price. I mean, I may barely get this out in time. Now right now,

00:38:12The Bitcoin price, it looks like it dropped.

00:38:16It did. Crazy.

00:38:18While I was recording,

00:38:20Down to 43,300.

00:38:24Actually, down to

00:38:2843154,

00:38:30which literally was the top

00:38:33of the ascending triangle.

00:38:36Ascending channel. That ascending channel is just nuts how well that thing is holding up. It's crazy.

00:38:43But

00:38:43we get bad news, it'll break right through that channel.

00:38:47I I would not be surprised at all to I see 35,000,

00:38:5133,000,

00:38:5230,000.

00:38:54I think once you hit 30, we're gonna see a lot of buying going on.

00:38:59But, yeah, I mean, it could be bad news and it could really drop, or it could be the exact opposite.

00:39:05Statistically,

00:39:06I think at this point, most likely, we're seeing that upward push, and we're certainly set up for it. We have the perfect, beautiful,

00:39:15Ascending

00:39:15channel that I've been talking about, we're up above it. We've built a bull flag, actually.

00:39:21We're kinda ready to rock and roll.

00:39:24When it

00:39:26breaks, basically, that 4044a

00:39:29half, $45,000

00:39:30level

00:39:31for the day or longer.

00:39:34Really, probably even a little longer than that. We're gonna be off to the races, and it won't stop until we at least hit 50,000.

00:39:41I definitely could see it going higher, at least temporarily.

00:39:46So there we go. 42 minutes in, we're gonna thank some supporters, and we are gonna shut it down.

00:39:53Awesome.

00:39:54You know, it's funny this week. I had one boost. I actually had more streaming than normal, so I I do appreciate that.

00:40:02We had user 487940

00:40:06799

00:40:06sent a 100 sats on

00:40:09January 1st,

00:40:10listened to the year end review, and, boosted a 100 sats. Like I said,

00:40:16And by the way, user 48794799.

00:40:20I really appreciate that, of course.

00:40:23But I do wanna mention, we did have some streaming going on as well, and, of course, I appreciate that as well. So A little down, I have not been as regular as I would like to be. Going forth from the in the New Year, I've got to finish this transition over to the new computer,

00:40:39Figure out things with Reaper. I don't completely have it set up.

00:40:43I'm not sure completely, but hopefully, in the next few days, I can get that resolved.

00:40:48And we're gonna talk about privacy for a couple weeks, and then we're gonna roll into some other things. So

00:40:53we will see how that all goes.

00:40:56What else do we have to wrap it up?

00:40:59We're a podcasting 2 point o podcast. Of course, we're a value for value podcast as I talk about all the time. I don't have ads. I don't have sponsorships.

00:41:08I don't have anything like that.

00:41:10You,

00:41:11as the listener, Can support the podcast

00:41:14because of the value that you receive from this podcast.

00:41:18That's what I'm looking for.

00:41:20I do depend on my audience to grow this podcast. I depend on people supporting the show. If you like what you hear, please go out and tell somebody. Go put a review. Go put it on Apple Podcasts. I used to say, don't put it on Apple Podcasts. I'm not an Apple Podcasts fan. The podcast 2.0 stuff,

00:41:39which is available at podcastapps.com,

00:41:43is much, much better than the Apple Podcast apps.

00:41:47But, hey, if you're using Apple Podcasts and you wanna put a review up there, go for it. I would really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart. I don't know where else you can go and put reviews

00:41:58anywhere that you could. I would appreciate that.

00:42:00How do you get a hold of me?

00:42:02Well, one really easy way is just send me a boost.

00:42:07This user

00:42:0848 whatever sorry. User 48

00:42:11blah blah blah. I don't remember the number,

00:42:13but they could've sent me a boost. They could've said, hey, McIntosh. Great show. They could've said, hey, McIntosh. You suck.

00:42:20I don't care.

00:42:21I am always looking for feedback. Hey. Your sound stinks. Well, tonight, maybe It's a little off because I've got all the effects turned off. I really don't know what's going on there,

00:42:31and I apologize for that. But yeah.

00:42:34Whatever.

00:42:35Just give me feedback, good or bad. I can take both. I'm a big boy.

00:42:39Let me know. That's it. You can reach out to me. I'm on Twitter at McIntoshFintech

00:42:44.

00:42:45Sorry. Yeah. McintoshFintech. I'm on mastodon at Macintosh

00:42:49at podcast index dot social.

00:42:52You can reach me by email at macintosh@satoshisplebs

00:42:57.com.

00:42:58And, of course, there's the website satoshis-plebs.com

00:43:01as well.

00:43:02That's about it. I'll talk to you guys next Thursday.
```
