And what a year it was!! It's easy to forget what happened in the last year. The price of $BTC and crypto in general might not have exploded as we would probably all like but there was much that was newsworthy.

In  addition to covering the major news of 2021 I highlighted what I think are the going to major trends of 2022 and even made a prediction for the Bitcoin price in 2022.
