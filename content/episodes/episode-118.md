We have begun to see nation-state adoption of Bitcoin. El Salvador may have been the first, but they will not be the last to move from a fiat standard to a sound-money Bitcoin standard. This week we will explore how countries might make that leap, when they might make it and even discuss a bit of everyone's (least) favorite subject -- how will taxes work on a Bitcoin standard!

Weekly Close BTC July the 23rd: $30,072.12
