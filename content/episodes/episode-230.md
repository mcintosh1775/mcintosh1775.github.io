In episode 230 of "Satoshi's Plebs", McIntosh and Kenshin tackle the question on everyone's mind: is this the start of a bear market? With Bitcoin consolidating around $107k and noise on the internet getting louder about a potential downturn, the hosts dive into price action, market sentiment, and what indicators might signal a true bear market versus healthy consolidation.
