00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome back to Satoshi's Plebs for episode two forty one. I'm Mcintosh.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.320
And I am Kenshin. And in today's episode, we are looking back, why looking forward?

3
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:22.625
Beautiful.

4
00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:23.985
Perfect.

5
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.064
We did so much better this week.

6
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:30.020
That's what a little practice will do for you. Yeah.

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.260
Yeah. Here we are.

8
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.940
So, Kenshin,

9
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.260
I'm since you've already told me a little bit, I'm going to put on my

10
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:43.835
psychologist

11
00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:45.274
Doctor. Fraser

12
00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:49.114
hat. Right.

13
00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:53.434
Is this Those of you who are following, that's a TV show,

14
00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.950
and say, Kenshin, I'm listening. What's up with you?

15
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.110
Well, doctor, it's been a difficult week.

16
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.070
I'm sorry to hear that.

17
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.110
Yeah.

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.430
What's going on with you?

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.595
Oh, it is okay.

20
00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:12.915
It's okay. Days are passing fast.

21
00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:16.674
Busy days, busy weeks.

22
00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:17.475
So,

23
00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:19.314
yeah.

24
00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:21.634
Just getting impatient again

25
00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:27.710
to get things done but it's not so easy. Should I ask if is the website done?

26
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.909
No.

27
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.870
No.

28
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.830
No. The the more the closer you get the longer it takes. Right? Or something like that. It's There's a there's a mathematical

29
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.790
term for that in calculus as you approach the

30
00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:46.315
I don't know what it is, but you never actually get there but it's really, really close. Yeah.

31
00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.955
I I mean, we're so close.

32
00:01:49.515 --> 00:02:03.010
We're even preparing the press release and everything. So it's Oh, wow. I think we're very close. It's just It'll happen. Yeah. Small things. And and it's all finding the time to finalize this last task and

33
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.729
balance out the AI capacity

34
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.690
also because now we're running to the weekly limits.

35
00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:10.985
Yeah. So

36
00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:19.065
I cannot do much more until Thursday basically with my account. I'm almost there knowing the limits. Couple of days of rest.

37
00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:24.180
Yeah. And rest is needed. I feel it now because Sounds like it. Yeah.

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.220
Yeah. I cannot sleep earlier than 01:00 in the morning, and I need to stand up at seven. So it's

39
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.620
it's been a bit hard a few days.

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.135
I feel you. I know. I don't get up that early, but I do understand.

41
00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:41.455
Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:42.815
How are

43
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:45.215
you know,

44
00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:49.615
I'm doing okay. We yesterday was a holiday

45
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.510
for a lot of people in The United States. It's Martin Luther King Day. Oh. Okay. I think it's his birthday and I'm pretty sure about that. And

46
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.830
so I didn't have to work, so we had some fun. We went for a walk,

47
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:08.725
really a hike with some of our friends yesterday. We walked about four miles.

48
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.965
That was good. Good exercise.

49
00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.485
I don't know if you noticed,

50
00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:17.045
listener,

51
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.020
but I did get the new microphone going. That's what I'm using right now. I would like to say it's gonna make me sound

52
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.460
spectacular,

53
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.980
but the reality is it probably isn't, but that's okay.

54
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:31.265
It is a better

55
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.865
sounding unit. It's a Electro Voice

56
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:36.545
RE three twenty.

57
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:51.190
And I haven't edited the podcast with it yet, so I don't really know what it sounds like. But Kenshin said, yep. I was a 100% better. Right, Kenshin? Yep. It's gonna make all the difference. Gonna make all the difference.

58
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.590
Oh, one other thing.

59
00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:03.845
I tackled my first major project. So I finished up the tool, first of all, so that we have this little automated tool now that will just spin out new episode

60
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:04.885
content

61
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:06.005
for the website.

62
00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:17.820
But I did start on a new thing, and I'm gonna go ahead and talk about it. I kinda told you, Kenshin, and I've mentioned this in the past several times, but I wanna take a few minutes.

63
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:26.060
This might be something later on down the road after I open this up that others are interested in. It will be an open source project.

64
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:31.735
Mhmm. And I wanna kind of briefly describe my my vision. I

65
00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:33.255
I I

66
00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.695
alright. Everybody knows I'm a boomer.

67
00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:39.175
Not really, but y'all think I am.

68
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.310
And I was around when Internet was dial up and

69
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.310
all that kind of jazz.

70
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.990
One of the earliest

71
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.030
protocols,

72
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.545
I don't know if you knew this, but that was built on top of the Internet was actually email.

73
00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.505
SMTP or SMTP.

74
00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.905
It certainly proved to be a huge success,

75
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.305
but it has flaws in it.

76
00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:08.385
Mostly around the fact that back when it was designed and built,

77
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.420
the Internet was a different place and nobody could even comprehend that you would spam people

78
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.860
for profit.

79
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.580
Right.

80
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.660
They just couldn't understand that. It was not in their

81
00:05:22.135 --> 00:05:26.695
it didn't make any sense. It still doesn't, but people do it. So

82
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.295
it's something that we have to deal with. But email

83
00:05:30.855 --> 00:05:37.975
as in something that I can keep literally for decades and I can point back to emails in my email

84
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.640
Thunderbird that I use now that I literally are from the early twenty twenties. Not twenty twenties, the early twin February.

85
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.760
Okay?

86
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.840
It is a long

87
00:05:50.335 --> 00:05:51.055
term

88
00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:52.655
communication

89
00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:54.735
system that can be very flexible

90
00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:56.735
and whatever.

91
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.175
But all of this

92
00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:03.615
spam stuff makes it a mess and they do all these things to fix it and nothing really works.

93
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:15.010
And I said, and I'm not the only person to come up with this idea by the way, and maybe not even the only person, the first person to implement it. I'm not aware of any other implementations.

94
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.930
But

95
00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:21.915
I said, why don't we bolt on Satoshis to this and

96
00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:25.115
make people pay essentially to send emails?

97
00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:32.155
And I haven't worked all all the details. But essentially, if I'm gonna send you an email kinship, I'm gonna pay a few Satoshis

98
00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:33.910
Mhmm. For that privilege.

99
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.270
Right. And

100
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:42.870
there's economics behind that. I haven't worked all that out and I will and we'll discuss that in the appropriate time.

101
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.669
But I began coding

102
00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:50.605
on this on Friday or Saturday. I think it was Saturday. I kinda lost track.

103
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:52.925
Using codecs,

104
00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:56.685
using this new chat GBT tool, and I've been blown away.

105
00:06:57.085 --> 00:07:00.285
I am literally, the last time I counted 9,000

106
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.600
lines

107
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.960
of code in.

108
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.080
I've got

109
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:13.360
I've actually been able I sent it to you. I've been able to test sending a message from one to to myself, but through the system.

110
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.000
Okay?

111
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:19.034
I've got test cases, I've got documentation,

112
00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:21.035
I've got I've got all the things

113
00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:25.835
and it's literally been like a day and a half, so

114
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:29.995
like twelve hours of work. Mhmm. That's what I mean by that. Okay?

115
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.680
Making a lot of progress. I am about halfway

116
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.240
to

117
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.720
a basically a dev

118
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.400
minimal,

119
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.880
what do they call it, MVP, minimal viable product. Right. Okay?

120
00:07:47.195 --> 00:08:11.740
Unless it proves to be like what you're talking about where the as the closer I get to the target, the harder it gets. We'll see. No. For an open source project like that, you don't need to be polished or Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're gonna I'm gonna put it together, make sure it works, and I'm gonna put it out there. And my intention is not only do people pay to send emails to soft spam,

121
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.574
the servers who run this back end are also gonna get paid

122
00:08:17.694 --> 00:08:20.414
for running or storing messages,

123
00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:24.335
for for moving them through the system, for all the things that they do.

124
00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:25.615
Okay?

125
00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:29.455
I we'll work all that out,

126
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:38.450
but money has to change hands or this makes no sense. People don't do things for free. Yeah. Okay? Either you

127
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:50.125
are paying for a service or you are paying in the fact that they're stealing all your data and selling it. And the inherent design of this system, and I'm not going to name it yet,

128
00:08:51.005 --> 00:08:56.605
but the inherent design of this system is that your data is secure and private

129
00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:57.485
to you.

130
00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:03.680
Okay? Mhmm. The server doesn't have access to it.

131
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.959
Right. It's end to end encryption.

132
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.865
So I know you've got a lot of questions. Questions. I do. So the server

133
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.945
that transmits

134
00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:17.305
is

135
00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.065
receiving a payment from the sender.

136
00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:23.785
It needs to. Yeah. And then

137
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:30.130
and then automatically it could split that revenue Exactly. To you Sorry. As the

138
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.250
I apologize.

139
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.530
Yeah. I was saying it it was just split automatically like like you do with a podcasting.

140
00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:42.755
Exactly. That it goes Exactly. And it's Part of to you Yeah.

141
00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:45.315
Part to the They gave me the idea.

142
00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:51.155
Yeah. One thing people don't understand is you can actually split satoshis up essentially.

143
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.050
Yeah. They're called millis satoshis.

144
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:59.650
And you can it's it's not like the satoshi itself is the limit. So,

145
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.490
you know, we're literally talking about a few satoshis or fractions of satoshis,

146
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.930
but if there's a lot of traffic,

147
00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.915
it it makes sense. Okay?

148
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:10.875
And

149
00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:12.075
even though

150
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:21.195
people don't understand the scale of of these spammers, they literally send millions of emails to get one person tricked.

151
00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:21.995
Okay?

152
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.860
And if you make it the least bit

153
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.700
non

154
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.940
profitable they they cannot operate.

155
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.740
I

156
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.904
I you know, have I just opened my Gmail yesterday.

157
00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:40.024
Yes. You

158
00:10:40.185 --> 00:10:47.144
mean the Google product that they harvest your data from in order to make it free. Yeah. Yeah. I'll just point that out. But okay. Exactly.

159
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.380
Because I never log in to Gmail.

160
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.100
I have

161
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.940
I only go on my phone. I have the k nine mail app. Mhmm.

162
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:05.964
And that fetches the Gmail stuff. Right. But for for once, I went because I want to reach it from my computer to type this long email

163
00:11:07.245 --> 00:11:10.125
because I'm going through a process now of reclaiming

164
00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:11.964
a product. Anyway, and

165
00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:22.720
I went out of curiosity in the spam folder because I said, have they sent me an email? Is it in the spam? I opened the spam folder. I was shocked. Yes. The amount of emails

166
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.800
in there. The amount of stupid,

167
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.079
yeah,

168
00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:28.815
invitations.

169
00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:30.415
Yeah. Garbage. They send.

170
00:11:30.975 --> 00:11:37.935
It's I opened a few out of curiosity. I always like to see what they do. It's incredible. Like Mhmm. There's the CIA

171
00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:41.135
director send an email that

172
00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.334
it's like, what?

173
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.450
You need to pay this so you get 15,000,000 or something. Right. Trace.

174
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.130
I you know,

175
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.650
look.

176
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.530
I've talked to a lot of younger people, frankly, and

177
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.995
they're like, well, email's dead. Well, email's dead because of spam,

178
00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:01.515
but email's dead.

179
00:12:02.235 --> 00:12:09.355
And I'm like, you say that, but what you don't realize is there's no other form there's nothing to replace it.

180
00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:13.675
You DMs are not email. DMs are essentially ephemeral.

181
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.810
Right? Email

182
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.450
is long term or it can be, certainly.

183
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.730
Sorry. Yes? And I don't wanna call this an email replacement

184
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.290
even though that's essentially what it is.

185
00:12:29.245 --> 00:12:45.550
Alright. Go ahead. I have many questions. Sorry. Well, I don't wanna turn this into a whole episode about this. But one more question, then we'll we'll move on. One more for the audience because the audience And I may not even have the answer. I'm still figuring some of this stuff out Yeah. Just seriously.

186
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.390
So you said it's end to end encrypted, and that's great. Mhmm. So

187
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.670
is the

188
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.230
service provider, the intermediary

189
00:12:53.964 --> 00:12:57.725
that transmits the emails back and forth, are they storing

190
00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:59.404
encrypted emails?

191
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.045
Yes.

192
00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:06.285
Okay. There so there is a center license. Yes. But they can't read it. No. Course. Know it belongs Yes. To

193
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.870
Can't you do that with NoSIR?

194
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:18.150
Yes. I'm using NoSIR. Can hear you. Good. Okay. Yes. So I'm using NoSIR for a couple of things. For the encryption

195
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.190
Yeah. And for the wallet connect,

196
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:21.990
ultimately. And

197
00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:32.345
I think there's maybe one more. There's like two or three nips that I'm gonna be using which are nostril improvement pro what's the p stand for? Protocol?

198
00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:34.025
Anyways Proposals.

199
00:13:34.505 --> 00:13:38.745
Proposal. Yes. Thank you. Nostril improvement proposals. I'm using like three of those.

200
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:46.210
And that's part of the fun of this because I pulled in the Noster Rust library, this is in Rust. And

201
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:58.205
boom, it just it went from my encryption was not working and I'm and I'm like, wait, wait, wait. There's gotta be a library for this. Sure enough, like nostr-rust.org

202
00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:02.685
or something. Yeah. Boom. Pulls it in. It's working.

203
00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:11.860
It's insane when this stuff works like that. Yeah. It's crazy. It's really good nowadays with the Thousands and thousands of lines of code.

204
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.100
I'm not gonna tell you I understand everyone and I don't.

205
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:22.395
But I I know I've got test cases that prove that this is doing what it's supposed to do. Yeah.

206
00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:24.235
Good.

207
00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:36.795
Very good. Looking forward to it. Enough about that. I don't know if we'll ever do a full episode on this but from time to time I'll probably mention it. Assuming I continue it which I probably will because I'm very excited about this.

208
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.180
Alright. Block height. As we record, nine three three one two six.

209
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.940
Alright.

210
00:14:46.260 --> 00:15:03.585
It's actually one two eight, but okay. Yep. Oh, well, no. Let's correct correct it. Nine three three one two eight. I'm sorry. Boy, we so I will mention this really quickly. It's funny because it hasn't been that long. It's been exactly fifteen minutes since we checked the price.

211
00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:06.910
And obviously we've gotten two blocks.

212
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:14.750
We're about to have a difficulty adjustment going down because our block heights are taking about ten point four minutes.

213
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:22.825
So that's actually kinda wild that it dropped out two more in the last fifteen Yeah. 3.5%

214
00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:24.985
difficulty adjustment.

215
00:15:25.465 --> 00:15:28.505
On top of the previous one that was 1.2%.

216
00:15:28.505 --> 00:15:33.080
So we are and we have a news item about that. I don't wanna get into all that right now. But

217
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.760
yeah.

218
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.160
Okay.

219
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.640
Right? We do have a news item.

220
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.560
We can have.

221
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.960
We can have a news item.

222
00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:47.075
Oh,

223
00:15:47.954 --> 00:15:48.755
Alright.

224
00:15:49.555 --> 00:15:51.875
Topic for this week. This week is going to be

225
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:53.714
look,

226
00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:55.475
ladies and gentlemen.

227
00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:59.635
I don't know if you've stuck your nose out of your hobbit hole,

228
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.110
But

229
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.550
the world is filled with doom and gloom right now.

230
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.030
Is that a true statement, Kenshin?

231
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.710
Yeah.

232
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:17.625
I don't pay much attention, but when I do, yes, it is very doom and doom. I so wish I could be like that. So

233
00:16:17.625 --> 00:16:18.265
nice.

234
00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:19.545
Yep. The

235
00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.745
bitcoin price is down.

236
00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:27.065
The sky is falling. World War three is right around the corner.

237
00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:29.145
This is happening. That's happening.

238
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.880
Apparently, here in The United States, we're all

239
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.040
fascist

240
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.120
or communist,

241
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.080
so on and so forth. It's not good.

242
00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:53.735
And I wanted to bring y'all a little light this week. Is that okay? Can we be happy for the next thirty minutes? Can try. Yep.

243
00:16:54.855 --> 00:16:56.535
I like to be optimistic.

244
00:16:56.535 --> 00:16:59.095
I feel like if we dwell too much on the negatives,

245
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:06.909
it's not good for us. It's not good for our health. It's not good for our life. And it's not good for our bottom line, frankly.

246
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.470
There are times when we have to be, obviously, when we have to be realistic.

247
00:17:13.005 --> 00:17:13.645
But

248
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:17.005
we get so swept up in the

249
00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:19.325
fear and engagement

250
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:20.044
and

251
00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:21.405
garbage

252
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:22.125
and

253
00:17:22.525 --> 00:17:23.805
it just it gets to you.

254
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.039
So we're gonna step back just a little bit.

255
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.440
And this actually comes from the tool that I built that enabled me to kind of populate

256
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:41.034
well, brand new episodes, it lets it write out the whole thing. Transcript, show notes, all the links, all the block height,

257
00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:42.075
all that.

258
00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:44.315
Really awesome. I love it.

259
00:17:45.275 --> 00:17:52.635
But it also let me go back and fill in some of the old datum. And it got me to thinking, ladies and gentlemen, I would direct your attention.

260
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.840
Are we ready for this? To the satoshis-plebs.com/episodes

261
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.960
web page. And if you go there,

262
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.600
that page is a list of all of the episodes

263
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.255
since day one. Now Kenshin's been along for a long time,

264
00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:16.295
but I did start this podcast back. I'm gonna get you the first date

265
00:18:16.455 --> 00:18:18.215
here in just a second.

266
00:18:19.335 --> 00:18:20.855
It was 2021.

267
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.299
It was August 16.

268
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.059
Now, Kenshin, I don't want you to go back quite that far yet.

269
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:38.255
Right now, as we record, let's just go ahead and give the price. Okay? Wanna go ahead and do that right now. Do we have an official

270
00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:39.375
Bitcoin

271
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:40.335
price?

272
00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:49.855
Yeah. For Let's get that recorded. For right now, you mean? Yeah. Well, you've got it listed here. Is it close enough to that? Yeah. 89,800.

273
00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:53.039
It hasn't like fallen off another cliff, has it?

274
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.159
No.

275
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.120
Okay.

276
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.520
89,800

277
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.799
US dollars. How many euros is that, sir?

278
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.945
What was it? $70.70

279
00:19:06.785 --> 00:19:08.545
$766,500.

280
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.144
500. Okay.

281
00:19:10.865 --> 00:19:11.664
Sweet.

282
00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:14.945
Alright. My dad's sending me pictures of manatees.

283
00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:20.304
Great. That's where we're at right now. We are

284
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:27.570
one hundred and a couple of days past our all time high. So like a hundred and five, I don't know exactly,

285
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.770
days from our all time high which was October

286
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.290
6, am I correct,

287
00:19:33.034 --> 00:19:33.835
of

288
00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:35.274
2025.

289
00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:38.715
Correct. And we hit a $126,000.

290
00:19:38.955 --> 00:19:39.595
Mhmm.

291
00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:42.075
Right? So we're down

292
00:19:43.195 --> 00:19:44.154
20

293
00:19:44.235 --> 00:19:45.434
plus percent.

294
00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:47.835
Is that correct? It's it's at least 20%.

295
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.750
Yeah. A bit more.

296
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.270
A

297
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.390
bit more than that.

298
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.230
And

299
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.270
if you stick your nose out on Cointelegraph

300
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.429
or one of these other sites,

301
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.550
the sky is falling. If you go on Bitcoin, Twitter,

302
00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:04.345
please don't.

303
00:20:04.585 --> 00:20:07.544
Just don't. I'm

304
00:20:07.544 --> 00:20:09.144
sure they're all saying

305
00:20:09.705 --> 00:20:11.144
the end is near.

306
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.705
Right? The US did not

307
00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:16.024
buy a million bitcoin.

308
00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:17.785
They're not doing monthly buys.

309
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.740
I don't know. I don't know what they're saying

310
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:30.220
because I don't go on there anymore. It's part of that whole thing I was talking about at the start. Right? There's only so much, goodness gracious,

311
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.060
that we can handle.

312
00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:37.144
My dad is down in South Florida and he's like sending me messages.

313
00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:39.384
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:43.065
He's my dad. I can't ignore him.

315
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:57.240
Goodness gracious. Manatees, more manatees and yet more manatees. Okay. Great dad. What is manatees? He's in Apollo Beach, Florida. You do not know what a manatee is? No.

316
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.280
Wow.

317
00:21:01.934 --> 00:21:03.215
They believe that

318
00:21:04.015 --> 00:21:05.134
the

319
00:21:06.174 --> 00:21:07.294
old sailors

320
00:21:07.294 --> 00:21:09.615
back sailing ship days Yeah.

321
00:21:10.095 --> 00:21:11.135
They thought they were

322
00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:16.174
they think that that's kind of one of the explanations for mermaids.

323
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.610
They look like a giant

324
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:22.929
Uh-huh.

325
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.170
I see. Just look it up.

326
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.890
In the winter in South

327
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:36.684
Florida, they kind of they they go up into the rivers and they they kinda congregate because they don't like the cold.

328
00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:38.445
So

329
00:21:39.805 --> 00:21:42.764
there's places. He's in Apollo Beach apparently.

330
00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:50.070
I'm not I I can't keep up with his goings on. This says he's in Apollo Beach

331
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.749
which is on the it must be down around Tampa,

332
00:21:54.230 --> 00:22:00.124
that area. And yeah, they just there's hundreds of these things out in the water. He's showing pictures.

333
00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:01.084
Okay.

334
00:22:02.205 --> 00:22:02.924
Sorry.

335
00:22:03.164 --> 00:22:08.124
I may cut that out, I may not. Little bit of flavor. Okay. Let's see how long the recording is.

336
00:22:08.764 --> 00:22:10.125
Back to what we were talking about.

337
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:19.420
So I'm populating out as much data here as I can because I like I'm I'm a perfectionist and I like things correct.

338
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.780
Back on 08/16/2021

339
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.140
when we first started,

340
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.744
you you just guess. Do you can you guess what the Bitcoin price was?

341
00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:36.744
I can see it, so I cannot guess. You can see it. You got your chart up, you cheater.

342
00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:41.210
Yes. You can see it. It was $46,000.

343
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.169
Now,

344
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:49.289
you know me and dates. Please help me out. Four and a half years ago. Right?

345
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.290
Yes. Four and a half years ago. Yeah. Four and a half years ago, we're at 46,000.

346
00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:58.835
Now let's describe the rest of 2021

347
00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.434
to give some context.

348
00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:03.075
I need to find my chart. Where did it go?

349
00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:05.554
Alright.

350
00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:07.475
Here it is. Back it out.

351
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.370
For those of you who weren't around in 2021,

352
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.610
that was the last year

353
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.649
of the bull run

354
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:25.315
the last year of the four year cycle, you know, we're gonna hit all time highs. So we said the same thing in 2025.

355
00:23:25.555 --> 00:23:28.995
So far that's proven to be accurate. Right? In 2025,

356
00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:32.515
in October, we hit a 126,000,

357
00:23:32.755 --> 00:23:36.050
and it seems like from that point we're now falling down.

358
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.210
Back in 2021,

359
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.250
that was supposed to be the same thing. And in fact, I'm going the wrong way, but in fact,

360
00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:49.605
we did. We hit our all time high

361
00:23:50.405 --> 00:23:52.085
in 2021.

362
00:23:52.805 --> 00:23:54.404
Do you remember the date?

363
00:23:55.365 --> 00:23:57.365
The the the last

364
00:23:57.365 --> 00:24:07.210
time or the No. Well, the actual all time high. So we kinda had a wild thing going on there. In November? It was in November. Right? It was 11/08/2020

365
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:13.210
week one. Of November. The week of. Yeah. We're on a weekly chart so please bear with us. It's a little bit

366
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.409
whatever.

367
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.170
But 69,000

368
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:16.650
roughly.

369
00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:20.264
Back in April

370
00:24:20.264 --> 00:24:21.264
2021,

371
00:24:21.265 --> 00:24:27.025
we also hit very close to that. It was slightly below it. I got 64,600

372
00:24:27.025 --> 00:24:28.065
from the top.

373
00:24:28.305 --> 00:24:28.945
Mhmm.

374
00:24:29.265 --> 00:24:30.865
That was the week of

375
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.710
April 12.

376
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:39.469
Okay? So what you ended up with was this u, this u shape. All summer long,

377
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.830
2021,

378
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.590
you were around, right, not on the podcast, but you were around. Yeah.

379
00:24:45.274 --> 00:24:47.514
It was so negative. The

380
00:24:49.274 --> 00:24:53.514
four year cycle's not right. We're all gonna die. The end is near.

381
00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:55.514
Know, buy Ethereum.

382
00:24:55.514 --> 00:24:57.355
I don't know. I don't know what they were saying.

383
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:07.260
And it was tough. And then we go back up, we hit a new all time high, and then FTX dumps and the whole world went to heck in a handbasket.

384
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:07.980
Okay?

385
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.019
Yeah.

386
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.554
So right in the middle of that, I start this podcast August

387
00:25:14.554 --> 00:25:15.554
2021

388
00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:17.554
at 40,000

389
00:25:18.995 --> 00:25:22.514
US dollars and we go up for a few weeks.

390
00:25:23.315 --> 00:25:28.300
I wanna do this based off the chart because I don't have a lot of these times. Of course, November,

391
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.580
we hit all time high at that point, 2021,

392
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.740
and then we start tracking down.

393
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.660
Alright?

394
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.260
Now

395
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.805
I had a very interesting episode. I'm gonna jump forward to it on episode 56,

396
00:25:43.805 --> 00:25:45.965
06/20/2022.

397
00:25:45.965 --> 00:25:52.685
So I wanna jump ahead in our chart just a little bit. 06/20/2022.

398
00:25:53.565 --> 00:25:54.525
That's March.

399
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.830
June,

400
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:58.509
there it is, roughly.

401
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:04.269
And man, if you look at that, we went from an all time high

402
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.629
straight down

403
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:13.295
for six months. It took one little brief, and that's not quite true. It went down. It went up sideways

404
00:26:13.295 --> 00:26:15.215
and then up just a little bit

405
00:26:15.535 --> 00:26:18.735
for, like, roughly a couple months probably,

406
00:26:18.815 --> 00:26:20.255
and then it went down again.

407
00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:22.015
So you go down,

408
00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.775
a little tiny up, and then down

409
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.129
to June 2022.

410
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:33.690
And I remember I mean, everybody was was I mean, it's the same story. We're all gonna die.

411
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:35.529
Buy Ethereum.

412
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.809
Buy Solano.

413
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.529
Buy whatever.

414
00:26:37.934 --> 00:26:39.614
You know, Bitcoin's dead.

415
00:26:40.014 --> 00:26:41.294
Bitcoin's dead.

416
00:26:41.774 --> 00:26:44.014
And so I recorded this episode.

417
00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:47.614
It was a great episode. It was the best. Oh, sorry.

418
00:26:47.855 --> 00:26:49.534
That was a terrible imitation.

419
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:56.919
I'm no good at that kind of thing. By the dip, 06/20/2022.

420
00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:00.360
I looked up on 06/20/2022.

421
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.559
The price was

422
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.759
$20,599.

423
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.075
Yeah. So ladies and gentlemen, I have been sitting here for the previous 50 episodes saying,

424
00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:13.195
DCA,

425
00:27:14.075 --> 00:27:15.914
you should be buying Bitcoin.

426
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:17.515
To be honest,

427
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:25.429
early on, of course, I'm going, you should be buying x, y, or z. Although I did emphasize Bitcoin, I do remember.

428
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:34.924
The the very third episode was called the king of crypto, an overview of Bitcoin. So, you know, I did have my priorities mostly in order. Anyways,

429
00:27:37.165 --> 00:27:38.445
that being said,

430
00:27:38.685 --> 00:27:41.884
here on episode 56,

431
00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:43.804
I'm saying buy the dip.

432
00:27:44.685 --> 00:27:48.365
I'm saying buy the dip. The price is $20,000.

433
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:50.409
It's half of what it was

434
00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:52.489
when I first recorded

435
00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:54.570
back in August

436
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.690
'21.

437
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.690
And I'm sure there were listeners out there, Kenjin, who thought I was crazy.

438
00:28:01.544 --> 00:28:04.825
Can you believe that? Can you believe people would think I'm crazy?

439
00:28:06.345 --> 00:28:06.984
Yeah.

440
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:09.544
So

441
00:28:10.265 --> 00:28:11.945
and that's 20 k.

442
00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:15.784
If you draw a line in the 20 k

443
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.750
and you scroll back, you hit the top of twenty eighteen.

444
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.309
Yep.

445
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.149
So this that that was a great spot.

446
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.230
Bottom of

447
00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:35.674
that cycle was the top of the previous cycle. Yeah. That's fine. Okay? That's how it works usually. Yeah.

448
00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:40.394
Really great spot to buy the dip and I was right.

449
00:28:40.715 --> 00:28:45.510
We should have bought the dip. I hope you bought the dip. I bought the dip. Did you buy the dip?

450
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.790
Yeah.

451
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:53.590
You have a story about this time period, don't you? Yes. I do. Why don't you go ahead and tell that? I do. It was that summer,

452
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.590
I was talking

453
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.350
to my father-in-law.

454
00:28:57.845 --> 00:28:58.565
Mhmm.

455
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:03.765
And I was reading some books and I was getting more and more excited about Bitcoin again.

456
00:29:04.165 --> 00:29:04.645
And

457
00:29:05.685 --> 00:29:07.365
I was DCN at the time.

458
00:29:07.765 --> 00:29:08.965
And I

459
00:29:09.365 --> 00:29:14.179
think I it was the first time I started DCN, actually. I understood what it was.

460
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.500
That was the time that it clicked for me that Bitcoin was savings, not

461
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:25.085
Right. Day trading or investments in that sense. Right. So that's when it all clicked for me, unfortunately.

462
00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:27.404
Or fortune eventually. Yeah.

463
00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:30.605
It was yeah. I mean,

464
00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:36.205
considering how long I knew about Bitcoin. Oh, I see what you're saying. I'm like, wait. What?

465
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.440
It took me a while.

466
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:45.879
No. I get that. So I was explaining a lot of things to my father-in-law. We were sitting out here in a nice summer day,

467
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:57.335
and then he turned and looked at me. He's like, okay. Okay. I All all good and fine. But what? Now we miss the train. I mean, it's 20 k. It's 20 k. Missed the train.

468
00:29:57.575 --> 00:30:05.830
It's a lot of money. It's it's never gonna go much higher. Now we miss the train. Yeah. And it went six x since

469
00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:13.910
the new all time high that we had now. Right. It did. Six x. Okay. Let's let's carry on a little bit more.

470
00:30:14.635 --> 00:30:18.715
I think we're getting across the idea, but I just wanna continue on.

471
00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:26.155
Again, going back to the chart where where in June, what does it do from there?

472
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.249
I lost my place. 2022,

473
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.529
January.

474
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:34.929
March down.

475
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.129
Okay.

476
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.129
May, June. Right.

477
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.049
So the rest of the summer, it cranks sideways.

478
00:30:42.675 --> 00:30:44.915
In fact, really the rest of the year.

479
00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:46.515
January

480
00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:47.475
2023,

481
00:30:47.475 --> 00:30:48.755
it's like it woke up.

482
00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:52.755
And if you look at the chart, it just starts climbing. All

483
00:30:53.955 --> 00:30:54.835
the way up

484
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.279
to 73,000

485
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.559
on

486
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.799
03/11/2024.

487
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.599
Right?

488
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:16.775
Took a little breather there, went sideways a little bit more, and then kept right on going up and hit over the course of last year, of course, all the way up to a 126.

489
00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:20.054
So if you would have bought that dip in 2022,

490
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:22.135
you would have been

491
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.299
above board

492
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.860
essentially the entire time at that point.

493
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.779
When the world is screaming sell sell sell,

494
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:31.980
when

495
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.299
everybody is doom and gloom,

496
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.899
if you understand,

497
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.980
if you've done your research

498
00:31:38.335 --> 00:31:49.695
and you need to do that because I can't tell you what you should do other than I believe this is the best asset in the world. Other than I I know from looking at the code,

499
00:31:50.014 --> 00:31:54.399
etcetera. It's got a 21,000,000 cap. It's got it's decentralized.

500
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.799
It's censorship resistant. All the other things on and on and on.

501
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.399
Why would I not invest in that

502
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.600
asset

503
00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:07.514
at that price?

504
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:13.195
When I believe that there's nowhere left to go but up. Right?

505
00:32:13.515 --> 00:32:25.350
Right. Why would I not? Why would I not do And this is why we DCA. And I talk about it all the time on this podcast almost every week. I say, DCA.

506
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:26.309
DCA.

507
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.350
Dollar cost average. Go on strike if you can. Whatever whatever

508
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.790
method works for you,

509
00:32:33.725 --> 00:32:37.245
whether that's daily or weekly, be buying your Bitcoin.

510
00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:43.804
And try not to worry about the price. And when you see things like this, when everyone is saying

511
00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:45.645
as they are right now,

512
00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:47.485
the sky is falling,

513
00:32:48.125 --> 00:32:48.765
we're dead,

514
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.860
gold is gonna be the new bitcoin.

515
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.100
I'm sure that one's probably been said.

516
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.019
No, silver. We should talk about silver. Oh my goodness.

517
00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.940
Silver's the new bitcoin.

518
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.700
No, silver's not digital.

519
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.225
I can't send you silver all around the world just like in ten minutes. Can't do it.

520
00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:10.025
I cannot do that because

521
00:33:10.185 --> 00:33:14.265
one ounce of silver, which is worth roughly a $100 at this point,

522
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:22.629
it's still an ounce of silver. I have to mail it. I have to insure it. I have to do all the things

523
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:29.669
to get it from point a to point b. It is not inherently digital. Does it have great use? Yes. There's

524
00:33:30.145 --> 00:33:32.865
industrial uses for it out the wazoo,

525
00:33:33.025 --> 00:33:35.585
but it's not digital. It's not Bitcoin.

526
00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:37.345
It's not even limited.

527
00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:40.144
This is something people don't really understand.

528
00:33:40.225 --> 00:33:42.465
Well, gold is limited. Well, is it?

529
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.539
Did you know that there's, like, gold out in the asteroids out in the asteroid belt?

530
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.740
And eventually,

531
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.820
humans will be able to mine that, whether it's the the next five years or the next fifty.

532
00:33:59.115 --> 00:34:00.875
What if somebody just

533
00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:09.115
finds a huge gold deposit like they do from time to time? What happens if we figure out a way to extract it off the ocean floor?

534
00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:13.740
What if, what if, what if? It's not limited in that sense.

535
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.220
We don't know how much there is

536
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:22.220
and even if we know how much there is right here on earth, we don't know how much is even in our solar system.

537
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.940
We know how many Bitcoin there are.

538
00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:34.154
I can tell you exactly how many have been mined if I look it up. And then I can tell you that there's that many that have been mined and there will be 21,000,000

539
00:34:34.154 --> 00:34:36.154
in total in perpetuity

540
00:34:36.154 --> 00:34:37.755
and we will never change that.

541
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.230
Where was I going with this? My point, here's my point,

542
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.550
don't be like Kenshin's

543
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.590
father-in-law.

544
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.830
It is not too late.

545
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.590
We may

546
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.270
be going down.

547
00:34:54.005 --> 00:34:57.285
Kenshin and I have been very open about this. We don't know.

548
00:34:58.005 --> 00:35:01.605
We may go down, we may go up, we may go sideways.

549
00:35:01.845 --> 00:35:11.280
It seems like we wanna go sideways and I'm I'm frankly tired of it but that seems to be the pattern. We get down to this area and then we just kinda rebound.

550
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.920
And it's showing it on the charts. I mean, you can now go back

551
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.480
to November

552
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.359
2024.

553
00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:22.405
So it won't be,

554
00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:23.845
well,

555
00:35:24.005 --> 00:35:24.725
I mean,

556
00:35:25.045 --> 00:35:26.005
four months

557
00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:27.925
and it's a block

558
00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:31.765
in between basically 80 and a 126

559
00:35:31.765 --> 00:35:34.245
and it just sits there and goes back and forth.

560
00:35:34.405 --> 00:35:36.085
Mhmm. Right? Very slowly.

561
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.260
But I

562
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:40.780
don't know.

563
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.860
But view this time look, we were talking like

564
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.620
Bitcoin went all summer through that pattern. Right?

565
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.260
$20.22

566
00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:58.155
that you were just talking about. Yeah. That's a blessing that you can you can buy Bitcoin at cheap prices.

567
00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:01.915
Yeah. And in a few years, and it won't take many,

568
00:36:02.795 --> 00:36:03.515
five,

569
00:36:03.835 --> 00:36:04.155
eight,

570
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.300
Can you even think ten years in advance? Goodness gracious.

571
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.340
Where

572
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:17.660
are you gonna be? You're gonna be sitting around looking at the Bitcoin that you bought at a 100 k going, man, I wish I would have bought more.

573
00:36:19.194 --> 00:36:21.355
You know Right? You know what happens?

574
00:36:22.234 --> 00:36:23.435
My father-in-law,

575
00:36:23.435 --> 00:36:29.915
I just remembered, like, year or two later when Bitcoin was double or triple or whatever it was, maybe more.

576
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.810
Mhmm. I said something about Bitcoin, and he said, no. I don't I don't want to hear it. I know.

577
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:36.650
He knew

578
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:42.090
that it had gone. So he knows, but is he buying? No. Of course not. No. Okay.

579
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.850
So that's unfortunate.

580
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.570
But

581
00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:46.405
I feel like that, you know,

582
00:36:47.365 --> 00:36:52.805
I I go through kinda some of the same stuff with my own family and I do what I can to

583
00:36:53.525 --> 00:37:00.005
maybe at some point I'll be able to help them out. But, you know, at the end of the day I'm responsible for my family,

584
00:37:00.325 --> 00:37:01.850
my immediate family,

585
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.610
and I'm working on that.

586
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.730
You know?

587
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.010
So

588
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:11.850
this is another one of those buy the dip moments, maybe. We'll see.

589
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:23.645
If it goes further down, I would say it's buy the dip then. What if we go down to 70 k? I don't We could. That's the We could. Previous all time high. So that's, I would say, the bottom.

590
00:37:26.045 --> 00:37:28.925
So we reached that all time high.

591
00:37:29.645 --> 00:37:30.445
Am I correct?

592
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.120
There it is. Okay.

593
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.280
Yeah. So

594
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.760
that was back in 2021.

595
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:47.945
It would certainly provide strong support. I'm not gonna say that it's yeah. But, yeah, we've not been down. The closest we got

596
00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:50.025
once we broke through

597
00:37:50.665 --> 00:37:52.505
was 74,000

598
00:37:52.505 --> 00:37:53.785
back in

599
00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:55.225
April.

600
00:37:56.505 --> 00:37:58.740
Mhmm. So, yeah. Technically,

601
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.620
we've not been down to that point. We certainly could go down there and plummet. And if it we do,

602
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.340
that's the real buy the dip moment.

603
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.740
In the meantime, just DCA.

604
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.420
If you feel like

605
00:38:11.785 --> 00:38:13.145
like I do,

606
00:38:14.265 --> 00:38:18.265
I just don't have anything left to buy other than my DCA. But

607
00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:24.890
I don't think we're going past 80. I don't. I think that's kind of been the established pattern

608
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.090
here, but we'll see.

609
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:28.650
Can't 100%

610
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.650
no. I can't a 100% say that for sure. Yeah. Things happen

611
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.410
and could crush it for But reasons outside

612
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:45.745
that I won't mention the exact scenario I said. But if earlier before we started recording, I told Kenshin, if we drop to 10

613
00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:51.744
for because of the world, I'll just say that, because of events in the world,

614
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.460
I

615
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.660
will be buying every bit of Bitcoin I possibly can

616
00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.020
because I have the utmost belief

617
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.780
that it will go up

618
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.620
unlike

619
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.420
possibly everything else in the world.

620
00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:07.715
Well,

621
00:39:08.195 --> 00:39:14.755
personally, what I do is I I increase my DCA now that we're going down a bit. So

622
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:19.075
when it's a bear market, I think it's a good time to DCA even more.

623
00:39:19.555 --> 00:39:19.875
Right.

624
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:26.010
Yeah. And I don't I just don't know that we're in a bear market yet, but

625
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:31.690
if if if you have the ability to do that during a a bear market period

626
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.210
like 2023

627
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.570
was, for example,

628
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.115
then by all means, carry on.

629
00:39:37.435 --> 00:39:38.075
Right?

630
00:39:39.355 --> 00:39:44.475
Is there anything else you wanna add or is that about it? I don't wanna overly elaborate on this.

631
00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:48.715
No. It's good to have a low time preference, look ahead. Yes.

632
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:49.930
And

633
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.850
this year and

634
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:52.890
yeah.

635
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.290
Hold. But just it's it's an amazing thing,

636
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.970
honestly. And it's this is not what I planned. It's just what happened.

637
00:40:01.595 --> 00:40:03.835
Go to that episodes page

638
00:40:04.075 --> 00:40:06.474
and scroll through those first

639
00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:08.315
few pages.

640
00:40:08.714 --> 00:40:13.435
There's eight pages in total, and it looks like basically the first

641
00:40:13.914 --> 00:40:14.395
four.

642
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.460
So the 50%

643
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.500
have almost all the monetary data filled in.

644
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:27.020
Then fifth page, not so much, but there is some there. Go scroll through it and think what were you doing at those points.

645
00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:32.725
Were you buying bitcoin?

646
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:36.565
Were you sitting on the fence? Were you thinking it'll go lower?

647
00:40:37.525 --> 00:40:38.485
I don't know.

648
00:40:39.685 --> 00:40:40.405
Okay.

649
00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:42.245
Okay.

650
00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:43.525
Enough about that.

651
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.760
Do we have a question?

652
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.760
Do we have a question?

653
00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:49.440
Do you DCA?

654
00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.280
I

655
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.720
don't wanna ask that question.

656
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.640
I hope everyone's

657
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.559
DCA ing. Do we have another question?

658
00:41:01.005 --> 00:41:03.245
Are they bearish or bullish?

659
00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:07.645
Yeah. How do we We can go and throw that out. That's kind of a gimme, but

660
00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:08.845
sure.

661
00:41:09.485 --> 00:41:13.485
Where do you think we're going from here? Let's let's measure the audience.

662
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.180
Mhmm. Very good.

663
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.780
Are we this is the right episode.

664
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.420
Yeah.

665
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.220
Yeah.

666
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.660
Alright. Our supporters.

667
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.875
Looks like we got a boost. Is this this is from this week. Right? Yep.

668
00:41:31.075 --> 00:41:31.875
Aldem

669
00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:35.075
sent us 210 sats, said just FYI,

670
00:41:35.155 --> 00:41:36.115
start OS

671
00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:40.595
o three five one. I assume that's like a version number. He uses pod man.

672
00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:43.555
And zero dot four dot zero

673
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.410
will use its own bespoke implementation on top of LXC.

674
00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.970
I've experimented with LXC a little bit as well,

675
00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.010
actually.

676
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.330
Reminder set your reminder.

677
00:41:56.049 --> 00:41:59.714
It does say reminder. No. That's Set your reminder. That's

678
00:41:59.714 --> 00:42:05.395
not from my That's not part of it. Okay. Yeah. Was like, why is Alden talking about that? Okay. Mhmm.

679
00:42:06.674 --> 00:42:08.595
Okay. So there you go.

680
00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:16.100
We talked about StartOS last week. I don't have a problem with them other than the fact that, frankly, it seems like they're

681
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.140
taking forever to get this new version out, but we'll see.

682
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.180
And we'll take a look at Novartis.

683
00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:22.980
Novartis?

684
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.339
Like like we said, when it gets put out. So Yeah.

685
00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:35.015
Don't forget guys we got the bullish market coming up. Think actually might come out tomorrow and this won't be out. Bummer.

686
00:42:35.015 --> 00:42:36.535
But it's every month.

687
00:42:36.775 --> 00:42:37.255
So

688
00:42:38.134 --> 00:42:41.974
and you can go to bullishmarket.onrender.com.

689
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.870
News notes.

690
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.350
I hear the hash rates dropped.

691
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.190
I wished I was making more money, but that's not really true.

692
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.310
Yeah.

693
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.350
The hash rate is at three

694
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.550
month low.

695
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.430
Yes.

696
00:42:58.655 --> 00:43:01.535
Don't know if this is because of the China mining ban,

697
00:43:01.695 --> 00:43:07.455
the price being down. I I suspect it's got more to do with the price than anything else.

698
00:43:08.494 --> 00:43:11.375
Yeah. It it's actually at

699
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.970
almost at the four. I I don't know how to calculate months in this,

700
00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.250
but we had the top three months ago

701
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:26.770
of the hash rates at one. When we hit the all time high, essentially. Yeah. I mean, it it follows it like a clock. I mean,

702
00:43:27.615 --> 00:43:33.055
they're making maximum profit at that point, so everybody's online. And as it goes down,

703
00:43:33.855 --> 00:43:38.335
the older machines become less profitable or unprofitable, so they turn them off.

704
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.410
Yeah.

705
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.730
It's just a very long downtrend

706
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.490
that it hasn't

707
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.930
been seen recently.

708
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:48.490
Go back four years.

709
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.490
Go back three years.

710
00:43:51.865 --> 00:43:53.305
The previous

711
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:57.865
low pattern going like that, a long term pattern was

712
00:43:58.265 --> 00:43:58.825
April

713
00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:01.865
from 04/30/2024

714
00:44:02.585 --> 00:44:04.552
down to July

715
00:44:04.552 --> 00:44:05.880
2024,

716
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.400
and then it started going up again.

717
00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:11.320
So similar downwards pattern. But Yeah.

718
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.000
I'm not sure.

719
00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.120
Yeah.

720
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:22.635
And we we are also competing with AI now. Right? Oh, yeah. All the resources so No doubt. Many servers might be,

721
00:44:23.355 --> 00:44:25.755
yeah, setting up AI stuff instead.

722
00:44:25.835 --> 00:44:28.474
They all think AI is gonna fix everything.

723
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.570
It may fix my mail program, but we'll see. Yeah.

724
00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:41.690
Price last January 20 so we already did the current price. It was 89,800.

725
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.565
Price last January 20 was $102.01

726
00:44:45.565 --> 00:44:51.805
45, so we are down 12%. So we are starting to fall while the price a year ago was starting to rise.

727
00:44:53.325 --> 00:44:55.805
We did have some interesting market cap

728
00:44:55.965 --> 00:45:01.670
numbers though. You wanna do that? Yeah. Bitcoin's market cap, that is at 1,800,000,000,000.0

729
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.550
USD.

730
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.830
Gold's market cap is at 33,100,000,000,000.0

731
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.710
USD,

732
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.270
which brings us to 5.4%

733
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.510
again.

734
00:45:10.305 --> 00:45:12.385
Last week, I think we were at six.

735
00:45:12.704 --> 00:45:15.105
Yeah. And then another interesting

736
00:45:16.224 --> 00:45:18.145
metric we can mention,

737
00:45:18.545 --> 00:45:20.705
silver that we used to be

738
00:45:20.944 --> 00:45:23.425
above silver a couple of years ago.

739
00:45:23.905 --> 00:45:27.270
Mhmm. Silver now is at the global

740
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:31.750
ranking number two behind gold. It's at 5,300,000,000,000.0

741
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.950
USD. So should I just DCA silver and forget Bitcoin? Yep. Mhmm.

742
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.670
Are we gonna become a silver podcast?

743
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.230
Yeah.

744
00:45:42.455 --> 00:45:55.815
Silver I got lost in YouTube while I was programming because you could kind of monitor things and whatever. It's just the way I work. I I had to put one part of my brain over here doing something. I don't know. That sounds crazy. But

745
00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:03.170
I was watching this video about this dude. He went down in a silver mine, an abandoned silver mine, dug out

746
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:05.330
ore.

747
00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.730
It's not just silver, but ore,

748
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:12.905
and then refined it down to get an ounce of silver. And it was crazy the work that that took.

749
00:46:13.225 --> 00:46:14.185
Yeah.

750
00:46:14.185 --> 00:46:15.945
Goodness. It

751
00:46:15.945 --> 00:46:17.065
was crazy.

752
00:46:17.225 --> 00:46:22.425
Like just the supplies alone, the cost of doing the stuff basically

753
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:23.625
took the

754
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.210
price of the ounce of gold or silver

755
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:34.810
and of course that didn't account for the time that he spent. He went 900 feet down and I mean,

756
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:43.415
he's a braver person than I am but it was kind of interesting. Silver is on a tear, there's no doubt, but silver's not a digital

757
00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:46.214
store value or currency.

758
00:46:46.855 --> 00:46:48.295
It can be a currency.

759
00:46:48.855 --> 00:46:50.535
It is not digital.

760
00:46:50.855 --> 00:46:55.095
And it's not a store of value or at least historically it really hasn't been.

761
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.030
It's got industrial

762
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:05.390
uses as well. But, you know, it's it's day right now. Maybe it's its day for the next few months. I don't know.

763
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:10.275
But I am fully confident that the Bitcoin

764
00:47:10.275 --> 00:47:13.315
price will continue to move upwards over time.

765
00:47:15.155 --> 00:47:23.155
Yeah. Very interesting though how it moves so far up. The last time we looked at that, said it was in ninth place. Right? Yeah. It was behind Bitcoin.

766
00:47:23.395 --> 00:47:27.290
Yeah. Yeah. It was around tenth, ninth place or something. Yeah.

767
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.530
Crazy stuff. Crazy.

768
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.210
But it is a hard asset, and I do believe

769
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.610
Bitcoin excuse me, silver and gold both are showing

770
00:47:38.015 --> 00:47:41.855
what's going on in our world. People are moving from risk off

771
00:47:42.495 --> 00:47:47.135
or or excuse me, people are moving into hard assets. Let me just say it that way.

772
00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:48.255
Right?

773
00:47:49.055 --> 00:47:50.255
And Bitcoin

774
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:56.310
certainly can be one of those in my opinion. I think a lot of people don't view it as such.

775
00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.670
Mhmm. But listen,

776
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.150
going back to the mining bit,

777
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.230
the ETFs mined

778
00:48:02.805 --> 00:48:03.605
bought

779
00:48:03.605 --> 00:48:14.005
far more Bitcoin in the last quarter than was mined. I saw I heard a number. I don't remember it. I don't have it in my notes, but it was, like, easily double or triple.

780
00:48:14.484 --> 00:48:16.165
So just the ETFs

781
00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:16.805
are buying.

782
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:26.050
I can't explain the price action. I'm not going to attempt to continue to buy your Bitcoin. It is a fixed supply. The price will go up.

783
00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:27.730
Yeah.

784
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:31.010
Fees and mempool.

785
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:38.105
You must have looked at this during a spike. I'm gonna go ahead and say it because it sounds good. 3 sats per fee byte and 38,000

786
00:48:38.105 --> 00:48:38.985
unprocessed

787
00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:41.305
transactions, about 98 megabytes.

788
00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:42.985
Are 44

789
00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:46.985
mhmm. It's it's 1 sats now. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why.

790
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.110
44.34%

791
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:53.630
to the next hot win,

792
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:54.750
which is

793
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:59.150
predicted at 04/11/2028

794
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.950
in approximately two years and eighty one days.

795
00:49:02.535 --> 00:49:05.815
Yep. You know what we'll be honest with you? We're close to 50 Yeah.

796
00:49:06.535 --> 00:49:13.895
Sorry. Yes. We are. Very close. We should have a 50% episode like a 50% sale episode. That would be awesome. Yeah.

797
00:49:15.015 --> 00:49:16.455
You know what would be funny?

798
00:49:16.615 --> 00:49:16.855
If

799
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:23.840
it moved up ten days somehow in the next two and a half years or, well, two and a quarter years,

800
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.240
and it was 04/01/2028.

801
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.280
Then we could be like, April fools. No. Just kidding.

802
00:49:30.915 --> 00:49:38.115
Yeah. We went through the no distribution last week. I don't think we need to cover that again. No. It's very similar. Although crazy.

803
00:49:38.115 --> 00:49:41.955
Knott's keeps going up. That puppy is gonna hit 25%.

804
00:49:42.275 --> 00:49:44.595
It was not at 22%

805
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.530
last week, and now it's at 21.92.

806
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.210
It was very

807
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.050
close. I I just Okay.

808
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:52.650
It was at 21

809
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:59.234
yeah. Whatever. I don't remember. It was very close. Very close to what it is now. Yeah. Alright.

810
00:49:59.714 --> 00:50:00.435
Hey.

811
00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:01.315
Stoshi's

812
00:50:01.315 --> 00:50:02.915

819
00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:44.580
That is the best way for us to grow. I looked on Apple this week. We have two reviews.

820
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.540
Five No.

821
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.660
Not actual sorry.

822
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.260
Not reviews,

823
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.300
like five star ratings. Two people gave us ratings. I don't know when that was done.

824
00:50:56.035 --> 00:50:57.235
No reviews.

825
00:50:57.795 --> 00:51:00.995
Oh, okay. We gotta guys, please,

826
00:51:01.395 --> 00:51:08.435
we could do better with that. I this is the one thing I'm gonna beg about. I hate begging for Apple, but it's just, like, super important.

827
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.130
For Is our

828
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:15.490
it showing the real name if you leave a review or a rating?

829
00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:17.730
I think it shows your

830
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:19.650
maybe.

831
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.610
Yeah. That's a problem. Maybe

832
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:28.235
that's the problem, but I know a lot of y'all really aren't concerned about that part of things.

833
00:51:28.875 --> 00:51:29.755
I don't know.

834
00:51:31.275 --> 00:51:39.070
This week's music, empty passenger seat by Joe Martin. Any boost for streaming of Sats during that song will go straight to the artist.

835
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:45.630
So thanks for joining us this week. You will hear from us again next Thursday morning.

836
00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:50.190
We hope this has been helpful, and we would love to hear from you on Noster or on Fountain.

837
00:51:50.915 --> 00:51:54.755
You can also find all our contact info at satoshitasplayoffs.com.

838
00:51:54.755 --> 00:51:58.115
Stay humble, DCA those stats, and have a great weekend.

839
00:51:58.355 --> 00:52:00.595
We'll talk to you all soon. Bye bye.

840
00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:22.005
And although they don't spell my name,

841
00:52:22.325 --> 00:52:24.885
I know that they will someday.

842
00:52:26.885 --> 00:52:30.085
Drinking all the backstage beer,

843
00:52:30.645 --> 00:52:33.445
trying to drown out your tears.

844
00:52:33.765 --> 00:52:34.805
Man, it's
