We know (and have seen) that having our bitcoin on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken is a bad idea. And in some jurisdictions it is becoming difficult to even purchase your bitcoin from these exchanges. So what is the solution? There is a group of exchanges called either "decentralized"or "peer to peer" that will always be available no matter where you live. Even though you might not need them today .. maybe it's best to know about these options for purchasing your bitcoin.
