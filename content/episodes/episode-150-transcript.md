00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:11.655
McIntosh: Hey, Pleb Nation. Today is January 7th, and this is episode 150 of Satoshis Plebs. I'm your host, Macintosh, and today's episode is why privacy matters.

2
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.160
Alright.

3
00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.864
Let's get on into it. I've been having some technical problems.

4
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:50.984
Not sure what's going on. I had to turn off all of my effects

5
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.370
In order not to sound like crap, it just was not working.

6
00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:11.010
I don't know. I'm in the process of transitioning to the new lap It's not a laptop. The new computer. I've not completed that yet. I have Reaper set up, but I thought I was having problems with that setup of Reaper, but it may actually just Reaper.

7
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.090
I'm not sure what's going on,

8
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.685
but we are not gonna let that slow us down, are we? So tonight, you get to hear my raw, unfiltered voice. I know you're excited about that,

9
00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:22.805
but,

10
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:30.780
And, we will drink the Earl Gray, with our honey to help out our throat,

11
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:40.555
and we will charge on. Let's do our market update. I am going to do everything in my power tonight to keep this down to about 30 minutes to 45

12
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:42.715
at the most. I'm gonna

13
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.110
Go through this, and then we're gonna jump right into

14
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.910
tonight's

15
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.550
topic, why privacy matters.

16
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.015
I'm gonna talk about some things. Let's do it. Bitcoin price

17
00:01:54.315 --> 00:02:02.990
closed January 7th, just a few minutes ago. 6th well, no. It's Been almost 2 hour, no,  2 hours and 40 minutes ago.

18
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.270
I got sidetracked.

19
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.710
43,948

20
00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:09.155
Dollars and 71¢,

21
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:14.675
which I do believe means we've had another weekly high. Let me double check that.

22
00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:16.195
No. We did not.

23
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.810
So we had, I think, 8 weeks in a row,

24
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.250
and then,

25
00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:28.584
Green, essentially, and then a down and then an up and then a down and then an up and then a down,

26
00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:31.700
but it wasn't by much. So,

27
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.540
overall, we're still in really good shape. We're on top of that ascending try channel

28
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580
that we've been sitting on since,

29
00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:41.425
We got

30
00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:47.205
we actually entered the channel on December no. Good gracious, alive.

31
00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:48.645
Back in October,

32
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.610
On the 23rd, we were in the channel. This is what I was thinking

33
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.890
of. Until oh, let me go down to daily.

34
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.810
I'm on the weekly chart.

35
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.005
Excuse me for just a second.

36
00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:09.959
I like to be as accurate as possible. We exited that channel on December 2nd, and we have been essentially daily closing above it certainly

37
00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.640
since then.

38
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.879
We'll be talking about in the news this week with Bitcoin

39
00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.075
ETFs, the so called spot ETFs,

40
00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.155
they are coming.

41
00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:25.875
We do look it does look like it will be this week that they will be approved,

42
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.050
Probably Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. I thought they were gonna slip up and do it Friday, but they did not.

43
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.410
They held off.

44
00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:36.355
But all the paperwork,

45
00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.635
at least, is what I understand is in place.

46
00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:42.675
The stamps are ready to be put down,

47
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.530
And the companies such as BlackRock are ready to be notified

48
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.490
that they can start selling

49
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:53.525
Spot ETFs in very short order.

50
00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:55.205
So that's a

51
00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:56.405
sneak peek

52
00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.565
at the news, but let me stick to my hedge doc notes

53
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.310
so I don't get off track. Our block height that time we're recording, 824,805

54
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.790
difficulty adjustment

55
00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:16.055
It was down or right now, if we had it right now, it'd be down 12.3%.

56
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.250
So that's pretty impressive,

57
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:30.105
drop. We've been going up quite a bit, so it'd be a welcome drop that will happen on January 21st, which, of course, Means we just had 1 a couple of days ago,

58
00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:34.105
and that difficulty adjustment was up.

59
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.990
And

60
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.590
let me see. Come on, time change calendar.

61
00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:41.669
1.65%

62
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.990
just a couple days ago.

63
00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:46.585
So not a huge spike upward,

64
00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:48.345
but yeah.

65
00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:54.510
Right now, it's looking like we might have a downward adjustment. I'm hoping for at least half For that, would be nice.

66
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.670
The fees in MN pool,

67
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:05.625
48 sats per vbite right now, which is better than it's been for a while. I've seen it as low as, like, 33. I think that was last night.

68
00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:07.385
We still have 1.77

69
00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:09.625
gigabytes of unprocessed

70
00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.490
transactions, which is just

71
00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:12.789
Nuts.

72
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.509
Okay. That's it. Market. Not gonna talk about it anymore,

73
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.990
until we get to the news.

74
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:22.475
I will talk about it a little bit more.

75
00:05:23.014 --> 00:05:23.915
I'll be honest.

76
00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:26.555
Alright. What are we talking about tonight?

77
00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:28.235
Why privacy matters?

78
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.040
You guys know

79
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.080
this has been stewing around with me for a while.

80
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37
This is nothing new, but we're gonna actually spend,

81
00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:47.900
I think 2 or 3 weeks talking about this. I am not gonna try and cram all this into 1 week. We're gonna kinda do some background today. And in the next episode, which should be Thursday,

82
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.860
we'll start diving into some Bitcoin

83
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.180
specific privacy techniques,

84
00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:56.745
and then we'll see if we need to do a 3rd episode.

85
00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:00.505
So why privacy matters? Why is privacy

86
00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:04.320
important? I'm going to talk to you from a

87
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.680
US centric

88
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.520
view as I always do because I

89
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:17.295
Have lived virtually my entire life in the United States. I have not lived here my entire life, but most of it. The 4th amendment.

90
00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.990
This is an amendment to our constitution,

91
00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.310
which is supposed to be a guarantee

92
00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.069
of the rights of

93
00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:26.205
the United States

94
00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:28.925
citizen. The 4th Amendment specifically

95
00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:41.400
deals with privacy. There's other amendments that do to an Dent, but this is when they talk about the privacy amendment, this is it. The 4th amendment is very short. It's literally

96
00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:46.085
one sentence. It's a long one, but it's one sentence, and I'm gonna read it.

97
00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:50.485
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,

98
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.360
Papers and effects

99
00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:53.960
against unreasonable

100
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.039
searches and seizures

101
00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.445
shall not be violated And no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause

102
00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:04.605
supported by oath and affirmation,

103
00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:05.885
and particularly

104
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:10.690
describing the place to be searched And the persons or things to be seized.

105
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.169
Okay? What does that mean? It means without a warrant, without a court order,

106
00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:22.785
You cannot go and search someone's house, their papers, their effects, their private

107
00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:23.745
property

108
00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:25.345
just because.

109
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.710
We see this extend out

110
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.310
in theory to

111
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.950
when you're driving down the road, they can't just pull you over and search your vehicle

112
00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:39.905
because they think that you're a drug dealer because of the way that you look.

113
00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.305
I'm gonna leave it at that.

114
00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:47.470
I know that's not a complete picture of what's going on, but bear with me. So,

115
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.310
McIntosh,

116
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:57.685
that is the US View. What is the worldwide view? Well, that's going to depend on what country you live in. But I do understand

117
00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.045
I do understand

118
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.085
that

119
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.730
There is a document

120
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.535
called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was published, I believe in the late 19 forties

121
00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:11.375
by the United Nations.

122
00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:14.575
In article 12, a right to privacy

123
00:08:14.955 --> 00:08:19.470
is expressly stated. What does that mean? Well, that means in theory,

124
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.430
the UN buys into this idea that people should have privacy.

125
00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:32.945
We see in various countries around the world various levels of this in more

126
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.090
Dictatorial

127
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.930
comp countries,

128
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.810
countries that are authoritarian,

129
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.954
we see abuse of this. We see people with a lack of privacy.

130
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.435
Why is this so important?

131
00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:48.274
It's important,

132
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.690
for a lot of reasons, but

133
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.895
you here's a common when you start talking about privacy, people will be like,

134
00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:02.515
Well, I'm not doing anything wrong, and I will be the 1st person to tell you to my knowledge,

135
00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:03.795
which

136
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.130
I I have to preface that because with,

137
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.130
say, our tax code

138
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.330
or our regulations, our laws and regulations

139
00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:15.355
In the United States that we currently have, I

140
00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:16.555
could be violating

141
00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:22.075
a law and not even know it. But to my knowledge, I don't run around

142
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.080
violating laws. I have nothing to hide, so to speak. I could be one of these people saying that, but I understand

143
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.560
the importance of privacy.

144
00:09:32.385 --> 00:09:34.725
And we should not just give that

145
00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:39.125
up because, quote, you know, we're not doing anything wrong.

146
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.490
Because there are places, and I have been to

147
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:45.329
one of them at least,

148
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.290
where

149
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:48.925
That right is not guaranteed.

150
00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:51.644
And, subsequently,

151
00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.125
you have a government who's out of control,

152
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.670
who does everything in his power

153
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.829
to monitor the populace

154
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:04.715
and tie everything to that. And I don't wanna dive into that too deeply,

155
00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:08.655
But let's just say that that is the case.

156
00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:11.855
And they will take things that

157
00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:14.335
you're not harming other people,

158
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.300
And you're not hurting the government. You're not doing anything except minding your own business, but you're violating

159
00:10:21.915 --> 00:10:25.055
A rule of theirs, and therefore, they're going to come down on you

160
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:26.895
very hard.

161
00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:28.655
And you may lose

162
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.830
Financial privileges, you may lose,

163
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.750
family access. You may be put in prison.

164
00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:40.575
And this is not a joke.

165
00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:42.175
So

166
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.654
these things are important.

167
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.290
Your employer

168
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.010
shouldn't be able to see where you spend your paycheck. It's not their business.

169
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.654
The convenience store that I go to To make a small purchase from,

170
00:10:58.035 --> 00:10:58.535
maybe

171
00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:00.375
a Coke

172
00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:04.455
or candy bar, I know I shouldn't be eating those things, but let's be

173
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.860
They shouldn't see how much money I have, how much money I control,

174
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.935
and where else I go to make purchases.

175
00:11:15.394 --> 00:11:17.334
These are just 2 simple examples.

176
00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:22.935
My neighbors don't need to know my financial matters.

177
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:30.550
My friends don't and I love my friends, but they don't need to know my financial business unless I

178
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.950
reveal that to them,

179
00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:35.315
If I choose to do that

180
00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:37.654
by the way,

181
00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:40.535
we should probably actually define

182
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.300
Privacy.

183
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.740
Privacy is the degree that you have control over access to your information.

184
00:11:50.815 --> 00:11:54.195
No. I don't want my employer to know my financial business

185
00:11:54.735 --> 00:12:04.270
outside of they pay me a certain amount of money to work for them a certain amount of time, and and that's it. That is that is the extent of the contract that we have made.

186
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.710
I don't want the convenience store to know everything that I've ever done.

187
00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:12.175
That's privacy.

188
00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:14.575
I can reveal

189
00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:16.015
that.

190
00:12:16.395 --> 00:12:19.295
It doesn't mean it's a black hole and you can't ever

191
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.050
See that. I can choose to allow that to happen,

192
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.450
but I have the right

193
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.970
to the privacy,

194
00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:30.025
to the ability to block that.

195
00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:36.820
We get this confused, especially in kind of crypto or Bitcoin circles as we talk about here,

196
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.360
with anonymity.

197
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.280
Anonymity

198
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.960
is just

199
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.640
the lack of a link between a transaction

200
00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:47.965
and your personal

201
00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:49.325
identity.

202
00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:51.085
So I'm anonymous

203
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:54.605
if you don't know who I really am. And as y'all know,

204
00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:55.805
I

205
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.459
Use a pseudonym,

206
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:09.785
Macintosh. That's not my real name. In no part is that my real name. You cannot Google Macintosh and find a picture of me. You find a picture of my ancestor, which I've talked about before.

207
00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:12.105
He was a Creek Indian chief,

208
00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:14.584
pretty famous around 18/12.

209
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.570
Okay?

210
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.450
He was one of my ancestors, but

211
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:25.815
I just chose that name because I knew who he was, I knew what he had done, so on and so forth.

212
00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:29.435
And it's a way to for me to have anonymous

213
00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:31.755
actions.

214
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:33.835
It's not privacy.

215
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.770
It's private

216
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.130
if the

217
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.850
2 parties who are involved,

218
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.890
typically,

219
00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:48.345
are the only people who know about details. That's privacy. I'm giving you 1 Bitcoin.

220
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:58.015
You know that I'm giving you that. I I know that I'm giving it to you and so on and so forth. That's it. But nobody else knows,

221
00:13:58.975 --> 00:14:00.195
Even the government,

222
00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:02.675
even the state,

223
00:14:03.215 --> 00:14:03.715
even

224
00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:06.610
your friends, your family, your Church,

225
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.529
your employer,

226
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.529
all of those things. Right?

227
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.850
Alright.

228
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:19.375
So Keep that in mind as we're talking about all this, and we are specifically talking about privacy.

229
00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:32.105
Anonymity is Often linked with that, but they are 2 slightly different things. I came up with what I call a privacy axiom. What is an axiom? An axiom was something I learned in mister Hollingsworth's

230
00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:33.705
geometry class.

231
00:14:34.245 --> 00:14:37.865
Way back in 9th grade, I was not a very good geometry student,

232
00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:41.210
but they had these Axioms and geometry.

233
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:48.650
I don't know. All 3 angles, I think this is an axiom. I hope I'm not wrong. I didn't look it up.

234
00:14:49.165 --> 00:14:50.785
All 3 angles of a triangle

235
00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:52.865
have to add up to a 180

236
00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:55.825
degrees. I think you could call that an axiom.

237
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.850
It is a provable

238
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.730
truth.

239
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.210
It is, in some cases, is what they call a self evident truth.

240
00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:09.815
That's another way of putting it. It's self evident. If I add up a 100 triangles

241
00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:13.415
that the inside angles are going to come out,

242
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.279
to a 180 degrees. I think that's right. 60, 60, 60, 90.

243
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.839
Yeah. 90, 45, 45.

244
00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:23.255
Yeah. 180.

245
00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:24.615
Right.

246
00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:29.495
You'd be proud of me, mister Hollingsworth, if you're still alive.

247
00:15:30.355 --> 00:15:30.855
Anyways,

248
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.750
I have an axiom that I came up with, and I did make this up. I've never heard this before,

249
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.590
at least in this form.

250
00:15:41.154 --> 00:15:41.654
Regardless

251
00:15:42.035 --> 00:15:44.455
of what amendments, laws, or articles,

252
00:15:45.154 --> 00:15:49.495
articles like this one about from the UN, are in place about privacy,

253
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.500
Government surveillance

254
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.780
will continue

255
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.900
to increase

256
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.260
over time.

257
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.045
Think about that.

258
00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:01.464
Think about the amount of monitor okay. Just

259
00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:03.865
right here in the United States,

260
00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:05.065
just recently,

261
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.660
It was beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is not a conspiracy theory uncovered that

262
00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:12.779
various

263
00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:17.555
Three letter organizations, I believe it was the FBI and maybe the CIA,

264
00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.435
but I don't wanna bet on that.

265
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.480
We're involved with

266
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.520
Facebook.

267
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.160
Facebook? No. Twitter.

268
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.360
Sorry.

269
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.940
Or maybe it

270
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:36.225
now I'm not even sure. I really should look this up. Regardless, they were monitoring customer traffic right in the building.

271
00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:37.425
No privacy.

272
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:40.390
Now Twitter, you can say, well, that's

273
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:47.110
a public service or whatever, but this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. They would have had access to details

274
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.625
that They should not have,

275
00:16:50.485 --> 00:16:57.144
and they were kicked out. They were removed. Now did, you know, Washington DC burned down? No.

276
00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.420
I'll give you another example.

277
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.620
I was just reading about this last night. I think I included this in the show notes.

278
00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:12.545
So and I'd heard about this before, but there's a case going on. This is crazy. I believe this is kind of a worldwide

279
00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:19.250
idea, but Here at least here in the United States, we have these things called safety deposit or safe deposit boxes.

280
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.955
When Maybe I've got some valuable papers, some

281
00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:25.075
coinage,

282
00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:30.355
maybe some jewelry, this kind of thing. I don't wanna keep it at my house.

283
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.660
I

284
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.980
go to a bank or

285
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.620
a business whose that's all they do, and it goes into a safe

286
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.915
deposit box. Now that is

287
00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:47.995
my property. It is going into this company whose their job is to

288
00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:49.860
manage That privacy

289
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.580
for me. There's a company in California. It's true story. I think it's in Los Angeles, but I do know it's in California.

290
00:17:57.095 --> 00:17:57.835
They went,

291
00:17:58.615 --> 00:17:59.915
excuse me. The FBI

292
00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:01.835
went in

293
00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:04.155
with some

294
00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:05.035
warrant

295
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.700
To get at

296
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.220
the business's

297
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.060
papers.

298
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.860
The business was under investigation.

299
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.565
This is Very important to understand.

300
00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:21.205
You've got the business. You got the safety deposit boxes of the customers.

301
00:18:23 --> 00:18:23.980
They went in

302
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.340
and grabbed

303
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.300
all of the safety deposit boxes

304
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.420
or safe deposit boxes, took them,

305
00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:36.034
Open them all up, cataloged everything in there, and then

306
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:39.475
literally the things of value in there,

307
00:18:40.015 --> 00:18:44.899
they took out And they started basically trying to pull into custody

308
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.505
in order to keep people from getting their stuff back. Now This is a complete invasion

309
00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:52.544
of privacy.

310
00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:54.625
I do not see how you

311
00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:56.144
reconcile that

312
00:18:56.684 --> 00:18:58.945
with the 4th Amendment, for example,

313
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.510
And that is being worked out in our court system right now. That's why

314
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:04.470
I

315
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.265
even knew about this.

316
00:19:07.305 --> 00:19:08.925
But my point is,

317
00:19:09.945 --> 00:19:13.805
this is a fairly recent I I don't think you would have heard about this even

318
00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:15.725
20 years ago.

319
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.430
Now maybe it did happen. Maybe I'm being naive.

320
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:27.105
But it certainly become easier for governments to monitor data, for governments to monitor Internet traffic,

321
00:19:27.485 --> 00:19:33.345
bank transactions, and all this kind of stuff. And the Bank Secrecy Act don't even get me started.

322
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.330
Y'all have heard me talk about this before.

323
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.810
What is it? Less than $10,000,

324
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.770
and

325
00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:48.955
The bank is basically going to be forced to ask you some questions about what you're doing with your money. With your money.

326
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:56.049
Well, I'm sending it to my grandpa because he needs it to stay in the old folks' home. It's none of your business.

327
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.865
That Started in, I believe the 19 seventies

328
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.385
in some form.

329
00:20:02.924 --> 00:20:06.650
I used to I did know at one point the actual time that

330
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.830
started. But regardless,

331
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.150
this is just another example of government overreach.

332
00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:16.475
Where is all this going, Macintosh?

333
00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:17.835
To me,

334
00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:20.635
Bitcoin has

335
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.115
2 primary functions.

336
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.540
Too.

337
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.540
Anything else?

338
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.620
It's

339
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.420
a store of value,

340
00:20:32.455 --> 00:20:34.235
which we'll be discussing shortly

341
00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:35.355
in the news.

342
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.195
And it's an so it's an investment,

343
00:20:39.895 --> 00:20:40.955
and it's a currency.

344
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.250
When I use it

345
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.810
as either one of those things,

346
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.810
let's

347
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.154
flip the tables here for just a second. Let's not talk about Bitcoin.

348
00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:53.195
Gold

349
00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:55.835
no longer really uses currency,

350
00:20:57.495 --> 00:20:59.195
still used by a lot of people

351
00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:00.669
As a story value.

352
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.110
If I own a block of gold,

353
00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:09.135
is it the government's business that I own that block of gold? No. Not really.

354
00:21:09.695 --> 00:21:13.395
If I choose to take that block of gold and put it into

355
00:21:13.935 --> 00:21:14.755
some financial

356
00:21:15.135 --> 00:21:15.635
instrument,

357
00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:19.530
that's probably going to mean that there's Some level

358
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.770
of privacy that I lose, but I have the ability to keep that gold all by itself

359
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.690
in my house in,

360
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:30.865
Say, a safe

361
00:21:31.404 --> 00:21:34.784
under lock and key. I don't have to tell anybody about it,

362
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.850
and it's my store of value.

363
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.610
So that's one of Bitcoin's primary functions.

364
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.650
And I want the ability to have that

365
00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:46.495
with as much privacy as possible.

366
00:21:48.235 --> 00:21:50.575
How do you do that? Well, it's no KYC.

367
00:21:51.995 --> 00:21:53.535
You don't buy it or exchange.

368
00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.400
You don't I don't know.

369
00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.660
Offhand, I I I I could

370
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:06.785
that would basically be it. And you will store it in your own self custody on a hardware wallet like a seed sign or this kind of thing.

371
00:22:07.245 --> 00:22:14.770
So certainly, theoretically and practically, you can do that. It's difficult to buy without kyc. That's

372
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.730
the snag.

373
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.010
My suggestion would be to talk to people at your Bitcoin

374
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.130
meetup.

375
00:22:21.405 --> 00:22:23.905
You may be able to buy from somebody there.

376
00:22:24.365 --> 00:22:25.905
You still need to be careful.

377
00:22:26.685 --> 00:22:32.430
But we're going to be talking about that more over coming weeks. So I don't want to get too deep into that.

378
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.430
Bitcoin is a currency.

379
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.950
Again, second use case,

380
00:22:38.414 --> 00:22:39.715
There are a lot of places

381
00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:41.155
where

382
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:46.275
buying certain things, doing certain things, making certain financial transactions

383
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.210
Can get you in trouble.

384
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.410
I will leave it up to you to

385
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.370
figure out, are these things

386
00:22:55.685 --> 00:22:56.905
Important for you.

387
00:22:58.325 --> 00:23:01.625
I'm not going to tell you what you should be doing with your money.

388
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:10.340
What I do wanna do is make it as private as possible because we do not know what's coming down the road.

389
00:23:11.615 --> 00:23:14.355
You know, when Russia invaded Ukraine,

390
00:23:14.735 --> 00:23:25.990
I said and the United States cut off The Russia from the SWIFT network, and make no mistake, that's where it came from. I said that's a bad move. Is Russia wrong to invade

391
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.190
the Ukraine?

392
00:23:27.674 --> 00:23:28.735
From my perception,

393
00:23:29.195 --> 00:23:29.695
absolutely,

394
00:23:31.195 --> 00:23:32.335
and it still is.

395
00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.700
That has not changed. But

396
00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:37.440
When you start messing with people's

397
00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:38.399
money,

398
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.880
and that's what that was doing,

399
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.360
that to me is like a sacred

400
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.240
thing.

401
00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:50.005
If I'm stopping the average person in Russia who may or may not agree

402
00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:51.525
with what the Kremlin,

403
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.330
Is it the I think it's the Kremlin.

404
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.610
Does. Then

405
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.710
I

406
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.170
that's a problem.

407
00:24:01.915 --> 00:24:09.455
And when we shut off the SWIFT network to Russia, that caused problems for the average Russian

408
00:24:09.995 --> 00:24:10.495
person.

409
00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:14.539
What if you go to

410
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.600
see, I'll think I pick on different

411
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.279
countries. I don't.

412
00:24:21.675 --> 00:24:22.735
Let's go to Canada.

413
00:24:23.355 --> 00:24:23.855
Canada's

414
00:24:24.155 --> 00:24:24.655
fairly

415
00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:25.855
safe.

416
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:37.159
The truckers strike that happened during COVID. I do not know if you agree with that or not. There's certainly a lot of division about that. Whatever.

417
00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:39.385
But you had people protesting

418
00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:40.745
in Ottawa,

419
00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:42.105
truckers,

420
00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:45.785
because they felt like they couldn't do their job.

421
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.080
And what did the government do?

422
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.600
If they can figure out who they were, they cut off access to their bank accounts.

423
00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:57.914
That's not right. That's not okay.

424
00:24:58.455 --> 00:24:59.815
You there's no

425
00:25:00.855 --> 00:25:08.920
there was no trial. There was no justice. There was no legal process. There was nothing. There was a court order that the

426
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.240
government managed to get,

427
00:25:11.654 --> 00:25:14.394
And they shut down their bank account. They froze them.

428
00:25:14.695 --> 00:25:15.755
That's not okay.

429
00:25:16.455 --> 00:25:18.794
You may or may not agree with the truckers.

430
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.650
It's not okay to block access to their money. Money

431
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.610
is something that everyone needs.

432
00:25:28.315 --> 00:25:29.455
And before we

433
00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:31.055
presume

434
00:25:31.595 --> 00:25:33.535
guilt, which was another

435
00:25:33.835 --> 00:25:36.495
amendment, I think, it's certainly in the constitution

436
00:25:36.795 --> 00:25:37.455
in whole,

437
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.800
You

438
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:49.495
you we have a right not to be presumed guilty, essentially. You have to prove somebody does something in order to take their money, to take their property.

439
00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:59.240
That did not happen in this case. And it does not happen with these random Seizures, just like the FBI thing that I was talking about.

440
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.720
The people who had

441
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:02.680
cash,

442
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:03.640
gold,

443
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.600
jewelry,

444
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.815
Other things like that in those safe deposit boxes,

445
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:18.549
they were not given a trial. They never appeared before a judge. They There was no guilt on their part. This was not about them.

446
00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:20.789
This was some vacuous

447
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.429
power grab by the FBI

448
00:26:24.775 --> 00:26:26.955
because they're trying to,

449
00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.795
as far as I can tell, just grab a bunch of stuff.

450
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.330
So I want my money to be as private as possible.

451
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:42.424
Let's talk about Bitcoin to wrap this up. I'm 30 minutes in. I Promise you I'm gonna be done in 45 minutes.

452
00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:44.184
In total,

453
00:26:45.605 --> 00:26:51
I'm I'm gonna stick to this this year. 30, 45 minute episodes. I'm gonna tighten it up.

454
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:52.760
Bitcoin

455
00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:59.225
is as private as you want it to be. This is a perception. I wrote this straight off of

456
00:27:00.565 --> 00:27:01.065
Twitter.

457
00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:06.100
No. It's not. No. It's not. I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2013.

458
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.180
When you say something like that, you presume that a person has the knowledge

459
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.765
to buy it without fiat, Without

460
00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:18.325
sorry. Without going through an exchange,

461
00:27:18.785 --> 00:27:19.285
without

462
00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:23.580
maybe they mine it. Maybe they Buy it from somebody,

463
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.580
at a Bitcoin,

464
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.100
meetup.

465
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.144
But you don't know who that person is, so maybe they're tracking you. I mean, it is Possible,

466
00:27:32.764 --> 00:27:33.825
and it has happened.

467
00:27:34.365 --> 00:27:34.865
Bitcoin

468
00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:43.830
by default is not private. And to be private, to have some level of privacy, and we're gonna be talking about The ways that we can do that over the next couple weeks

469
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.309
and what I hope our future innovations

470
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.270
in that,

471
00:27:48.895 --> 00:27:56.490
It takes technical knowledge at this point. It's not just point, click, tap, doop, bop, bop, and it costs Money

472
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.370
in

473
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.930
every case that I know of.

474
00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.810
It's not built,

475
00:28:03.535 --> 00:28:04.515
for the most part,

476
00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:06.835
into the protocol level

477
00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:08.995
of the Bitcoin main chain.

478
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:16.840
So when people say things like that, and I copied that Right off the Twitter, Bitcoin is as private as you wanna be. No fiat, no KYC.

479
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.159
That presumes

480
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.960
I am a tech smart person

481
00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:23.184
with access

482
00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:26.144
to things that the average person

483
00:28:26.845 --> 00:28:30.304
out there, even in the United States, won't have much less

484
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.880
A, quote, developing country

485
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.160
who,

486
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.760
you know,

487
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.560
maybe they make $5 a day

488
00:28:40.315 --> 00:28:44.495
And any kind of fees on top of Bitcoin, if they're even able to do Bitcoin,

489
00:28:46.235 --> 00:28:47.375
are a no go.

490
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:54.210
So one of the most misunderstood benefits of Bitcoin's blockchain, its main chain, is its pseudo anonymity.

491
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.730
This is because,

492
00:28:56.684 --> 00:29:01.024
Like I said, we kind of use these terms anonymous and privacy,

493
00:29:01.884 --> 00:29:02.384
interchangeably.

494
00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:04.465
That's not really true.

495
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.500
And it's really important when you're dealing with a Bitcoin transaction.

496
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.540
Your transaction cannot be anonymous

497
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17.044
if it is linked To your personal identity. If you do anything

498
00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:19.125
through Coinbase, through Kraken,

499
00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:21.525
through any of these exchanges

500
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.800
that you have to key in your personal identification

501
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.800
or take a picture or whatever to prove that you are you.

502
00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:31.625
You're now linked to that.

503
00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:34.424
And it's only private if

504
00:29:34.725 --> 00:29:35.465
we can

505
00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.544
the 2 parties involved

506
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.990
are the only people who have access to those details. The amount,

507
00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:46.625
where it came from, where it's going, etcetera. And who's involved?

508
00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:53.585
Because of the nature of a blockchain,

509
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.380
This so called ledger,

510
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.020
this actually counteracts

511
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.060
completely

512
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.540
this concept of privacy.

513
00:30:02.904 --> 00:30:04.524
The ledger is publicly

514
00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:05.565
distributed

515
00:30:06.105 --> 00:30:06.605
data.

516
00:30:06.985 --> 00:30:07.725
The transactions

517
00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:09.005
between

518
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.580
2 or more

519
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.100
parties

520
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.780
with some level

521
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.299
of anonymity.

522
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.220
That anonymity

523
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:25.195
is what Allows users to maintain some level of privacy while ensuring the ability to audit the 21,000,000

524
00:30:25.575 --> 00:30:30.760
in total Bitcoin. Of course, Not all those have been mined. You could argue they've not all been created,

525
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.120
etcetera. So

526
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.360
that's a problem.

527
00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:38.205
Let's see. We want privacy, at least I do.

528
00:30:38.745 --> 00:30:41.085
And I this is something I will argue about.

529
00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:43.885
But Bitcoin as a blockchain,

530
00:30:44.185 --> 00:30:45.270
as As

531
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.110
a ledger of record

532
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:57.765
directly opposes that. So how do we how do we get around that? Well, that's what we'll be talking about over the next couple of weeks. How can we do that?

533
00:30:58.625 --> 00:30:59.925
What are some things

534
00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:01.285
that can happen?

535
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.460
Alright.

536
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.620
News.

537
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.140
Not a whole lot, but there were a few things.

538
00:31:09.794 --> 00:31:13.414
I I wanna talk about the ETFs. I'm also gonna talk about

539
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:18.054
this news came out. I wanna go ahead and throw this out real quick, and then we'll dive into ETFs.

540
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.340
Bitmain is the main number one

541
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.260
immensely larger by volume

542
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.295
Bitcoin miner out there. They're based in mainland China, if I'm not mistaken, in South China.

543
00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:41.030
And they're huge, like, Probably, I don't know, 90 plus percent of the miners out there are Bitmain.

544
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.950
So it turns out and I don't know why this came up,

545
00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:45.935
but it

546
00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:49.295
did. Bring this up real quick.

547
00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:53.135
There was some oh, so Core Scientific

548
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.340
Was a is a hosting company, a mining hosting company. They mine. They also

549
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.355
they also host other people's miners. They're in bankruptcy or

550
00:32:02.895 --> 00:32:04.035
some state of bankruptcy.

551
00:32:04.335 --> 00:32:09.690
And because of that, they're dealing with the court. They had actually received court approval

552
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.610
to purchase, and I heard a guy on a mining podcast this week talking about this. They're purchasing

553
00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:18.145
27,000

554
00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:21.745
s nineteen j x piece from Bitmain,

555
00:32:23.404 --> 00:32:25.510
and, and here's the punchline.

556
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.270
And they're going to host an additional 27,000

557
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.390
s nineteen j x piece

558
00:32:32.845 --> 00:32:34.705
for the Chinese mining

559
00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:35.585
manufacturer.

560
00:32:37.165 --> 00:32:42.225
There's kind of been rumors about this, but this is definitive. This is a legal document.

561
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.330
Core Scientific is hosting

562
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.770
or will host

563
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.810
27,000

564
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.130
of the Bitmain miners

565
00:32:50.475 --> 00:32:52.575
for Bitmain. So Bitmain itself,

566
00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:53.695
the company,

567
00:32:54.235 --> 00:32:55.775
will be mining Bitcoin

568
00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:59.055
if they are not already. What does that mean?

569
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:08.210
The company that most people purchase miners from is directly competing with the miners. The irony of this is just

570
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.650
fantastic. Now

571
00:33:10.295 --> 00:33:14.875
My miners, they're all bit main. Why are they bit main? Well, they run well.

572
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:18.075
They are cheaper than, say,

573
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.830
The next one or any of them, really.

574
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:22.950
And

575
00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:25.269
they're the most convenient to get.

576
00:33:26.289 --> 00:33:34.044
And So 9 tenths probably of the minors out there, like I said, are bit man. There's certainly a significant percentage, well over 50%.

577
00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:36.044
But this same company

578
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.510
is

579
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.669
basically competing against the people that they sell product to.

580
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:44.070
It's crazy. I hope

581
00:33:44.865 --> 00:33:46.325
This either changes,

582
00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:48.085
I don't think it will,

583
00:33:49.185 --> 00:33:52.510
or people start migrating to other

584
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.950
companies.

585
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.550
I really would like to see more diversity in the Bitcoin mining space in terms of the hardware.

586
00:34:00.545 --> 00:34:04.325
I think we will slowly see that over the next few years, probably

587
00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:06.725
5 plus years, 5 to 10 years.

588
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.640
Anyways, that was some very interesting news for the miners out there.

589
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.800
Let's talk about ETFs.

590
00:34:15.015 --> 00:34:19.915
There was so much news about the ETFs this week. Twitter was was all up and

591
00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:21.994
whatever because

592
00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:23.755
because

593
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.630
They thought that basically the approval was gonna come

594
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.350
in the last couple of days, and it didn't happen.

595
00:34:31.905 --> 00:34:33.845
So I think we're looking at Monday,

596
00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:40.005
Tuesday, Wednesday, kind of the original time frame if y'all remember, 8 January 8 through 10

597
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.080
Based on when the filing started,

598
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:51.485
to see this, and I do think they'll be approved. And I think when that happens, we will see a lot of money

599
00:34:51.865 --> 00:34:55.965
flow into Bitcoin. I think a decent portion of it will happen immediately.

600
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:05.300
It would not surprise me. So this is kind of the 2nd part of my market update. I think if that happens this week, we can have 1 or 2 things. If

601
00:35:05.855 --> 00:35:06.595
If the SEC,

602
00:35:07.055 --> 00:35:11.635
for whatever reason, comes out and says this is not happening anytime soon, that's gonna

603
00:35:12.655 --> 00:35:15.475
drop the market. It may drop 5, 10

604
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:24.010
$1,000 wouldn't surprise me. People are so wound up about these ETFs. It'll bounce back, but I'm just saying it could happen.

605
00:35:25.095 --> 00:35:29.275
If it gets approved and there's in my mind, there's 95%

606
00:35:29.575 --> 00:35:30.714
chance of that happening,

607
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.530
Then

608
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.370
do we break 50,000?

609
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.670
I'm fairly certain we will over the next, say, month. So say

610
00:35:39.915 --> 00:35:41.535
Let's say by the end of February.

611
00:35:41.915 --> 00:35:43.455
Could we break 60,000

612
00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:44.975
by the end of February?

613
00:35:45.675 --> 00:35:46.975
I believe we could.

614
00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.370
And I think what I predicted

615
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.010
I'll have to go back and look at my notes.

616
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.050
But I wrote it up in the notes for last episode.

617
00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:56.925
By the happening,

618
00:35:57.865 --> 00:36:00.765
so in April, I think we'll be above all time highs.

619
00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:03.005
I think

620
00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:06.880
Some of it will be the ETFs. Some of it will just be the general

621
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.359
environment and what we see going on in Bitcoin and all this kind of stuff.

622
00:36:11.994 --> 00:36:19.694
I fully expect that. So you heard it first here, probably not, but, yeah, I think that's what's gonna happen. Now

623
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.900
I've said this or I've tweeted this or whatever.

624
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.340
Does Bitcoin need these ETFs? Absolutely

625
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.380
not.

626
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.205
We know do not.

627
00:36:30.085 --> 00:36:32.425
We do not 100% need these ETFs.

628
00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:34.345
What this will do, however,

629
00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:41.290
is start to open up the gates to the Wall Great money. It will start pouring in. These are big companies

630
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.690
that we're talking about. BlackRock,

631
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.530
Morgan Stanley,

632
00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:46.895
Fidelity.

633
00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:48.121
Van

634
00:36:48.848 --> 00:36:49.348
Eck.

635
00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:54.975
Van Eck, actually, in in another little bit of news. I thought this was really cool.

636
00:36:55.590 --> 00:37:00.010
And, well, we'll get to the cool part, and then we'll talk about what people are saying.

637
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.330
They're saying that they're gonna donate

638
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.425
a Pretty decent amount. 5 I think it was 5%

639
00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:08.745
of the fees that they collect

640
00:37:09.285 --> 00:37:10.610
to Bitcoin core development.

641
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:16.950
So, basically, it will help out the Bitcoin court work that goes on that's so necessary.

642
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:22.045
Now everybody's like, oh, well, they'll be in the pocket of Van Eck and blah blah blah.

643
00:37:22.345 --> 00:37:24.365
I suppose that's theoretically

644
00:37:24.665 --> 00:37:28.125
possible, but honestly, I don't think that's what's gonna happen.

645
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.900
I really don't think that they're gonna sway

646
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.380
any core developer to do something

647
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.984
to benefit an ETF or anything like that. I don't even see how Possible.

648
00:37:39.244 --> 00:37:42.545
But I wouldn't completely write it off, but it

649
00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:44.704
kinda seems like a conspiracy

650
00:37:45.005 --> 00:37:46.880
theory to me. So,

651
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.839
anyways, that was pretty cool.

652
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52
But everybody has updated

653
00:37:53.745 --> 00:38:00.885
They did their final documents. I think the vast majority of them have been updated. There's, like, a dozen companies involved at this point,

654
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:10.530
And it's just about time. So Monday morning, they may approve all this, and you may see the price. I mean, I may barely get this out in time. Now right now,

655
00:38:12.265 --> 00:38:15.005
The Bitcoin price, it looks like it dropped.

656
00:38:16.105 --> 00:38:17.565
It did. Crazy.

657
00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:19.245
While I was recording,

658
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.380
Down to 43,300.

659
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.620
Actually, down to

660
00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:28.515
43154,

661
00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:31.875
which literally was the top

662
00:38:32.735 --> 00:38:34.115
of the ascending triangle.

663
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:41.220
Ascending channel. That ascending channel is just nuts how well that thing is holding up. It's crazy.

664
00:38:42.694 --> 00:38:43.194
But

665
00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:46.555
we get bad news, it'll break right through that channel.

666
00:38:46.855 --> 00:38:50.320
I I would not be surprised at all to I see 35,000,

667
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.360
33,000,

668
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.480
30,000.

669
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.035
I think once you hit 30, we're gonna see a lot of buying going on.

670
00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:04.694
But, yeah, I mean, it could be bad news and it could really drop, or it could be the exact opposite.

671
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:05.790
Statistically,

672
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:13.470
I think at this point, most likely, we're seeing that upward push, and we're certainly set up for it. We have the perfect, beautiful,

673
00:39:14.684 --> 00:39:15.184
Ascending

674
00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:20.065
channel that I've been talking about, we're up above it. We've built a bull flag, actually.

675
00:39:21.405 --> 00:39:23.585
We're kinda ready to rock and roll.

676
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.130
When it

677
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:27.049
breaks, basically, that 4044a

678
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.450
half, $45,000

679
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.970
level

680
00:39:31.405 --> 00:39:33.345
for the day or longer.

681
00:39:34.045 --> 00:39:39.825
Really, probably even a little longer than that. We're gonna be off to the races, and it won't stop until we at least hit 50,000.

682
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44
I definitely could see it going higher, at least temporarily.

683
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:51.345
So there we go. 42 minutes in, we're gonna thank some supporters, and we are gonna shut it down.

684
00:39:52.605 --> 00:39:53.105
Awesome.

685
00:39:54.285 --> 00:40:01.339
You know, it's funny this week. I had one boost. I actually had more streaming than normal, so I I do appreciate that.

686
00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:03.740
We had user 487940

687
00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:06.045
799

688
00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:07.885
sent a 100 sats on

689
00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:09.565
January 1st,

690
00:40:10.185 --> 00:40:15.005
listened to the year end review, and, boosted a 100 sats. Like I said,

691
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.930
And by the way, user 48794799.

692
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.010
I really appreciate that, of course.

693
00:40:23.075 --> 00:40:38.820
But I do wanna mention, we did have some streaming going on as well, and, of course, I appreciate that as well. So A little down, I have not been as regular as I would like to be. Going forth from the in the New Year, I've got to finish this transition over to the new computer,

694
00:40:39.174 --> 00:40:42.474
Figure out things with Reaper. I don't completely have it set up.

695
00:40:43.015 --> 00:40:46.795
I'm not sure completely, but hopefully, in the next few days, I can get that resolved.

696
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.380
And we're gonna talk about privacy for a couple weeks, and then we're gonna roll into some other things. So

697
00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.700
we will see how that all goes.

698
00:40:56.234 --> 00:40:58.095
What else do we have to wrap it up?

699
00:40:59.195 --> 00:41:07.780
We're a podcasting 2 point o podcast. Of course, we're a value for value podcast as I talk about all the time. I don't have ads. I don't have sponsorships.

700
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.860
I don't have anything like that.

701
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.660
You,

702
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.575
as the listener, Can support the podcast

703
00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:17.415
because of the value that you receive from this podcast.

704
00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:19.815
That's what I'm looking for.

705
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:38.375
I do depend on my audience to grow this podcast. I depend on people supporting the show. If you like what you hear, please go out and tell somebody. Go put a review. Go put it on Apple Podcasts. I used to say, don't put it on Apple Podcasts. I'm not an Apple Podcasts fan. The podcast 2.0 stuff,

706
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.820
which is available at podcastapps.com,

707
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.340
is much, much better than the Apple Podcast apps.

708
00:41:46.855 --> 00:41:57.230
But, hey, if you're using Apple Podcasts and you wanna put a review up there, go for it. I would really appreciate that from the bottom of my heart. I don't know where else you can go and put reviews

709
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.870
anywhere that you could. I would appreciate that.

710
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:01.870
How do you get a hold of me?

711
00:42:02.365 --> 00:42:05.025
Well, one really easy way is just send me a boost.

712
00:42:06.765 --> 00:42:07.505
This user

713
00:42:07.805 --> 00:42:10.225
48 whatever sorry. User 48

714
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.960
blah blah blah. I don't remember the number,

715
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:18.525
but they could've sent me a boost. They could've said, hey, McIntosh. Great show. They could've said, hey, McIntosh. You suck.

716
00:42:19.885 --> 00:42:20.785
I don't care.

717
00:42:21.484 --> 00:42:30.400
I am always looking for feedback. Hey. Your sound stinks. Well, tonight, maybe It's a little off because I've got all the effects turned off. I really don't know what's going on there,

718
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.200
and I apologize for that. But yeah.

719
00:42:34.145 --> 00:42:34.645
Whatever.

720
00:42:34.945 --> 00:42:38.805
Just give me feedback, good or bad. I can take both. I'm a big boy.
