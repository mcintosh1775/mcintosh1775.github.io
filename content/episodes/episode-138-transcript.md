McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, Sat Stackers. Today is October 19th, and this is episode 138

00:00:05of generation Bitcoin.

00:00:06I'm your host, Macintosh. And today's episode is

00:00:10about the lightning network usage.

00:00:42Alright.

00:00:44Let's get right into it.

00:00:47Yeah. We'll be talking about the Lightning Network today. Of course,

00:00:51shortly after I did episode 134,

00:00:54on lightning,

00:00:57River Financial posted a a a review,

00:01:00which they've done

00:01:02at least they did it a year ago as well,

00:01:05on lightning network usage. They're one of the largest nodes in the lightning network,

00:01:09and they're one of the people who have the best

00:01:12ability to kind of see what's going on. Now understand before we even dive into this report

00:01:18and some additional information

00:01:20about

00:01:21podcasting 2.0 stats

00:01:24in kind of the network that we use to support shows like mine.

00:01:30A lot of the Lightning Network is private, private nodes running behind Tor,

00:01:35so on and so forth. And it's very difficult to

00:01:39really understand it all what's going on.

00:01:42So you'll see in this report that they talk about kind of lower bounds,

00:01:47And so what they're saying is it can't be any less than this, but it's certainly more. You can read that into it because

00:01:54there is an unknown number of

00:01:56nodes and

00:01:58and such out there that

00:02:00that are not being accounted for in this report.

00:02:03So. Anyways, we'll get all get to all that in a minute. We've had some good feedback.

00:02:10Bitcoin is pumping.

00:02:13We'll talk about that for a minute. Our block height at time of recording, let's just go ahead and throw this out there, is 8129

00:02:21fiver

00:02:223812

00:02:23953.

00:02:25We probably need to talk about that for just a little bit.

00:02:29Why don't we just jump on into our market update?

00:02:32Man, McIntosh, if you only had a script right in front of your eyes that you could

00:02:37actually

00:02:38used

00:02:39to keep on track. I have I have to work really hard to to keep on track even when I do have a script, and I don't have a script. I don't have a word for word script, but I have notes in front of me. By the way, I use Trillium for that on my umbral node. I found it fairly useful. I'm slowly transferring over

00:02:56my notes

00:02:58from Evernote to Trillium.

00:03:00So, anyways,

00:03:02market. Right now, as I record, we're at 8

00:03:0528,759.

00:03:08That will be the official

00:03:10price for today.

00:03:12As I record

00:03:13here on Thursday afternoon, unfortunately,

00:03:17I was tied up last night with some work stuff, so I'm having to record later than normal. Sometimes duty calls,

00:03:24I was actually not I was not on call this week, but,

00:03:28I got pulled into an HBI after having to work late already on some other issues.

00:03:35And so,

00:03:37you know, it wrecked my whole night, to be honest. But because of that, I was able to get off a little bit early. So here I am recording,

00:03:44and I'll punch this out as quickly as I can.

00:03:47I do apologize for the delay during the week. Sometimes these things are just unavoidable.

00:03:52Anyways, 28,759,

00:03:54and we're actually continuing to pump up from there.

00:03:57If I open up

00:04:00trading view.

00:04:03I think overall,

00:04:06well,

00:04:07what we've seen is that things were not so well. We were kind of heading down.

00:04:13And then, basically, I think CoinTelegraph. It was either CoinTelegraph or CoinDesk, and I do not remember which. It should be in my news, but 1 or the other of them posted

00:04:24inherently

00:04:26that,

00:04:28BlackRock had been approved for a spot ETF approval, and it provided in an instant, you know, less than an hour $1,000 pump.

00:04:37And,

00:04:38of course, they retracted that. It's not true. Nothing in terms of bought ETFs has been approved, but the levels have stayed up.

00:04:46So, you know, we're we're moving back towards the top side of this box, if you wanna call it that. As we've discussed, we've got this box going on between

00:04:5525,031,000

00:04:57that's going back for months now.

00:05:00I do believe that when a spot ETF gets approved, we will break out of this box personally late if we're not alright. And that's my personal opinion. It's not financial advice, and I'm certainly not giving you trading advice, by the way.

00:05:15But

00:05:16I think there's a chance after that happens that it stays above 31,000.

00:05:21I'm not a believer that, you know, spot ETFs are gonna save Bitcoin. I don't even care whether they get approved or not. But the reality is is that they bring in Wall Street money.

00:05:33They bring in people who don't want to invest in Bitcoin in any other way, but they want to invest in Bitcoin. I get all that.

00:05:40It will continue Bitcoin's dominance

00:05:44march to dominance, I I should say,

00:05:47as a global reserve currency at some point.

00:05:51So it's necessary,

00:05:53but I don't really care about them.

00:05:56I would not recommend that you buy in a spot ETF. I would recommend that you own your own Bitcoin

00:06:02and you put it in your own

00:06:04hardware

00:06:05wallet. Seed signer seems to be the best thing going on right now. I am going to be building one of those in the next few months.

00:06:12I'll be reporting on that as I do it.

00:06:15And one other brief note, by the way, let's see. That clearly happened on October 16th, 16th, Monday,

00:06:22and it pumped all the way up to $30,000,

00:06:26kissed it 29,

00:06:28probably 29 99,

00:06:31and fell right back down, but it fell at a higher level. So, I mean, you very clearly can see that we've consolidated. We're building actually a flag formation, a nice flag formation.

00:06:44The Bollinger Bands are pinching down. We may be pressing back up towards that

00:06:4930,000, 31,000

00:06:50mark

00:06:51before the weekend. We'll see.

00:06:53That's certainly not financial advice, and I'm just

00:06:57rambling as I look at a trading view chart.

00:07:02What do we say here here at Generation Bitcoin Stack Sats. Buy every day. Use the strike app

McIntosh:00:07:08if you must.

00:07:10However you do that,

McIntosh:00:07:12just do it. Just do it daily. Don't worry about the price. Don't worry about,

00:07:17at worst case,

00:07:18weekly.

00:07:19I would not recommend monthly. You may get left behind at some point,

00:07:24and that would be a terrible thing.

00:07:28So just keep stacking those sats.

00:07:30Strike is an easy way to do that. There are other options certainly at this point. Oh, by the way, to close-up the market stuff, I did wanna mention,

00:07:40on 16th, so just a few days ago, we had an adjustment, estimate 6.47%

00:07:45up in the difficulty. So things are getting harder. And, unfortunately,

00:07:49right now,

00:07:51the next one will be on the 29th, so ten days from now, and it's looking like it's going to be another 5% or so up. Now I'm hoping that comes down

00:08:00because, frankly, I could use some more

00:08:02sats in my mining setup.

00:08:04It does look like we will have another upward adjustment. So what does this mean? Well, what it means is that more hash rate is coming online. As more and more hash rate comes online,

00:08:15there's more people competing. The blocks are getting mined faster. And, of course, as I've explained before, the difficulty adjustment essentially is designed to

00:08:24keep that block mining happening around every 10 minutes. Well, right now, it's not. It's happening faster than that.

00:08:32Our fees are still fairly high. They look like they've actually been kind of going up. Oh, well, look at their

00:08:40a minute ago, they were 15. Now they're 6 and 4,

00:08:45so priority is 6 sets per v byte.

00:08:48We're still over on the mempool,

00:08:51451

00:08:52megabytes. So,

00:08:55I don't know.

00:08:56No idea.

00:08:58But, yeah, it certainly looks like more hash is being added to the network.

00:09:03I think what is happening as Bitcoin goes up in price,

00:09:07miners

00:09:08that have been inactive

00:09:10because they can't afford to run the miners

00:09:13we're starting to bring those online.

00:09:16So there you go.

00:09:17I think that covers that. So we will move on

00:09:21to our topic.

00:09:23So this report, it's a it's a 20

00:09:27no. 45 page report.

McIntosh:00:09:32I've read through it.

00:09:35I'm going to summarize it in part.

00:09:38There's a lot of interesting things in here.

McIntosh:00:09:41Basically,

00:09:42in summary,

00:09:44despite

00:09:46a drop in Bitcoin.

00:09:47And despite

McIntosh:00:09:49a decrease in search interest,

00:09:52there have been more

00:09:54payments

McIntosh:00:09:56in the last

00:09:572 years, 2 years, 2 months since August 2021.

00:10:01So in the last 2 years

00:10:04or so,

00:10:06there's been

00:10:07an increase in lightning payments. That's the way to say it. Even though 44% price drop,

00:10:1445%

00:10:15decrease in search interest, which by the way directly relates to the price,

00:10:191212%.

00:10:22Now that's not a number.

00:10:24And in fact, what we see is that at least for the last year or so, the amount of Bitcoin tied up in

00:10:31lightning,

00:10:33certainly on the visible network, if you wanna call it that. I'm gonna kind of differentiate between visible and invisible,

00:10:40Tor based.

00:10:42That really hasn't changed a huge amount,

00:10:45not like this, but the number of payments is. And I that makes me very bullish. Show people are using the lightning network.

00:10:54That's the equivalent

00:10:56right now of 2.5 transactions

00:10:58per second.

00:11:00Bitcoin on chain is 4.4.

00:11:02So there you go.

00:11:04So we're

00:11:05basically

00:11:06halfway,

00:11:08no more than halfway

00:11:10to the amount of transactions that are occurring on the Bitcoin main chain.

00:11:14Now what would our fees be like if all this traffic we're on the main chain. I don't wanna think about it.

00:11:20Now the primary use case, and I'm gonna pick a bone here

00:11:24with this report. The primary use case driving transaction growth that we identified are, and we being River,

00:11:32gaming,

00:11:33social media tipping, and streaming.

00:11:36Now I don't know what they mean by streaming. Maybe they mean

00:11:40Podcast 2.0,

00:11:42streaming of sats while people listen. I assume they could mean things like streaming while watching

00:11:48a TV show. I don't know because I've never actually heard of

00:11:52I've only heard of streaming outside

00:11:55or in the context of podcast 2 point o. Now the interesting thing is is in this report, as far as I can tell, not once do they mention podcast podcast 2 point o,

00:12:05who, by the way, started, what, 3 years ago.

00:12:09Mhmm.

00:12:10And we do know from the stats that,

00:12:15the guys over at podcast 2 point o keep that the number of sats

00:12:21is fairly significant

00:12:23going across this podcast 2 point o network. Now I don't know. Again, I think from what I understand, these are kind of lower bounds.

00:12:32But over the last 90 days, $30,000

00:12:36over a 100,000,000

00:12:38sats,

00:12:391 Bitcoin

00:12:40has been transacted

00:12:42across

00:12:44value for value podcast 2.0

00:12:47lightning

00:12:48payments.

McIntosh:00:12:49Almost

McIntosh:00:12:531,000,000 transactions

00:12:55doing that.

00:12:57And the number of unique senders,

00:13:01if I'm reading this correctly,

McIntosh:00:13:04must be

00:13:07well, they don't have a number for unique senders, so I'm

00:13:10I oh, there it is. So it's like 295.

McIntosh:00:13:13It looks like 3 so the lower boundary,

00:13:16like, 260. There's the lowest.

00:13:19So let me see if I can figure this out,

00:13:22169.

00:13:23The highest is

00:13:26380, and that's, I think, on a daily basis. So between 160

00:13:31and almost 400 unique senders per day.

00:13:37So

00:13:38high volume, high transactions,

00:13:41honestly, low number of unique senders.

00:13:44Now,

00:13:45do they have groupings there? I don't know. Is, like, all the,

00:13:50Albi wallets, do they show up as one sender? I do not know.

00:13:55I would love to see that unique senders go up personally, but the point is

00:14:00there is a decent quantity

00:14:02of traffic that if you go back far enough, we know is growing.

00:14:07It's not in this chart, but if you go back in time, and they've talked about that on the podcast 2.0 show. How over the last few years, of course, this has gone up, and it will only continue

00:14:19to do so as more

00:14:21value for value podcast 2.0,

00:14:24shows come out or shows come on board. People promoting,

00:14:28hey. You can support this podcast as I will at the end of this show by doing what? By streaming sats, by sending boost,

00:14:38by becoming a part of this ecosystem

00:14:40still man, providing value for value instead of sitting like a dumb sheep and listening to a bunch of ads. And I'm sorry if you find that offensive.

00:14:50I I really am, but I I mean it. I mean, I hate listening to ads. Let's be honest.

McIntosh:00:14:56I fast forward through them whenever possible,

00:14:59and I find it

McIntosh:00:15:01look. I'm I'll tell you about a podcast I was listening to this week, and it was

McIntosh:00:15:06it was almost

McIntosh:00:15:07unlistenable, and I'm not gonna mention the name of the podcast.

00:15:11But it's a mining industry podcast

00:15:15that sponsored by a miner,

00:15:18one of the public miners or public hosting companies,

00:15:22and they had on

00:15:25the guy who's behind drive chain and one of his pals.

00:15:29And they were trying to explain

00:15:32to us plebs,

00:15:35how drive chains are awesome.

00:15:38It's the same song and dance they've been listen they've been saying for months.

00:15:43And I've listened to it,

00:15:44and I've read it, and I've dissected it. And as a miner

00:15:49and as a pleb, I completely reject it. I say, I do not need this.

00:15:54They say, well, this is going to increase

00:15:56miner profitability

00:15:58on the one hand, and on the other hand, they say things like literally in this podcast, they said one of the guys who was a miner,

00:16:06it wasn't Paul. Like, Jamie was his name.

00:16:09He said,

00:16:11well, you know, you gotta be running 50 megawatts to be profitable. I mean, that's almost word for word what he said.

00:16:18And, Jamie, respectfully,

00:16:20with any respect that's due, I would say, that's garbage.

00:16:25Now, if I have one miner, I have a higher chance of failure because maybe I have a hardware failure of that miner

00:16:32that I can't cover out of the operating cost.

00:16:35But let me tell you,

00:16:37if you're mining with one unit and you're upside down in that miner, in other words, you're mining less Bitcoin than it costs you to run that miner,

00:16:46then you're unprofitable. And I can be unprofitable at 50 megawatts. And at the same time, I can be profitable at one unit or ten units or a 100 units or a 1000 units. By the way, a megawatt at today's units. That's roughly 300 units.

00:17:02So if I'm doing that math right, what he said was,

00:17:08you can't be profitable

00:17:09at roughly 300

00:17:13times 50. How's that make you feel, plebs?

00:17:16Oh, and by the way, he also talked about having,

00:17:19not him, Paul. I I well, actually, I don't remember which.

00:17:24They were talking about yeah. We need to have, like, a behind closed doors meetings and not have literally said not have the plebs. Now I don't know who he meant by that,

00:17:33but I get very offended with crap like that gets said. Okay?

00:17:38It's not okay.

00:17:40This is an open network,

00:17:43and miners have to participate that in and and and

00:17:47and I don't mean miners. I mean public miners because that's who these people are starting they're trying to represent. And I think it's interesting

00:17:56that the

00:17:59CTO CEO.

00:18:00I'm not sure. Somebody very high up in Riot, if I'm not mistaken, who is the largest miner public miner in the world

McIntosh:00:18:10has come out and said this is not a good idea.

00:18:13So who's left, Paul?

00:18:15Because now you've ticked off to Plebs

00:18:19because, you know, we don't know what we're talking about.

McIntosh:00:18:24The public miners apparently aren't getting on board, so there's nobody left.

00:18:28So go pound sand.

00:18:30Go over to Litecoin

00:18:32and set up your drivetrain

00:18:34and show us how it works because we're too stupid to understand it

00:18:39after you've called 14,000

00:18:42people ugly names on Twitter.

McIntosh:00:18:46Ridiculous.

00:18:48Give people the time of day.

00:18:54Sorry.

McIntosh:00:18:56I didn't even mean to talk about that this week. I tell you, sometimes I think the best things I say are scripted.

00:19:02That may just be my opinion. I may have blown out half the audience right there, and that's okay because I'm allowed to have my opinion, and I have this microphone.

00:19:10You can fast forward. That's okay.

00:19:14I wouldn't even want Paul to come on the show. I can't have an honest debate with him at this point.

00:19:19For one thing, he's very good at talking.

00:19:22Maybe not very good at writing on Twitter, but he's very good at talking. He'll talk circles around you, but that doesn't mean that he's right.

00:19:30And I'm not gonna debate somebody like that

McIntosh:00:19:34because I'll look like an idiot,

McIntosh:00:19:38but I have taken the time to do the work.

00:19:41And I do have invested interest in what's going on.

McIntosh:00:19:45And I'm not some stupid idiot.

00:19:48I'm actually reasonably smart.

00:19:52So

00:19:53whatever.

00:19:55Moving right on. Sorry.

McIntosh:00:19:57I do apologize

00:19:58again,

00:19:59going back to lightning, which is what we're here to talk about. I do not know how I got off on that. So the point to this thing,

00:20:07the point to this report

00:20:09because I don't wanna make this week's episode too long. The point to this report,

00:20:14from what they can see,

00:20:16even though

00:20:18in some ways the network is not growing, even though Bitcoin price is down, even though

00:20:23Bitcoin searches are down, which are a direct indicator of interest.

00:20:27Lightning itself seems to be growing.

00:20:30Certainly, the number of transactions across lightning are growing.

00:20:34In the podcast 2 point o industry, we see this.

00:20:38There was 7 6,600,000

00:20:42transactions involving more than 2 nodes

00:20:44in public

00:20:46that showed up in August of 2022.

00:20:49If you have direct transactions, if my node opens up a transaction to your node, that often doesn't show up. If you have 2 private nodes over private channels, that certainly

00:21:00won't show up. So we know

00:21:02that,

00:21:02basically, 6a half 1000000

00:21:05were logged in August 20

00:21:0723. We don't know. I would actually estimate at least 25%

00:21:13more than that.

00:21:15And I'm not gonna do that math, but it's, what, 8,000,000 or so

00:21:20are actually occurring.

00:21:22So

00:21:23despite claims by Paul that the lightning network is dead, actually, that's, I believe, one of the things he said. Hard to keep up with all the stuff that comes

00:21:32from him.

00:21:34It is alive and growing. By the way, back in August of 2021, there was 503,000

00:21:40transactions during that month. That's actually oh, it's exactly 2 years. They're going from August to August.

00:21:47So that's where they get the 1212%

00:21:50growth. That doesn't mean that,

00:21:54there's 1212%

00:21:55more Bitcoin locked up into those notes. And by the way, there's things

00:22:01that I'm not really happy about lightning. I think it still got a ways to go.

McIntosh:00:22:08We do see a clear divergence.

00:22:10There's a chart here

00:22:12between

00:22:13the on daily lightning transactions on and daily on chain transactions. So if you compare the transactions

00:22:20they're occurring on the main net.

00:22:24It is,

00:22:27roughly, I said that 4.4 per transactions per second.

00:22:31Lightning is now 2.5,

00:22:33but the lightning is growing at a faster rate.

McIntosh:00:22:36I would argue that within the next two years that it will

00:22:40exceed that.

00:22:43So probably during the height of the next bull run,

00:22:47let's say August, not August, Q4 2025,

00:22:52when Bitcoin's going to be at an all time high, as I've said, and I'll still stand by that until proven otherwise. That's what the data has shown historically. It doesn't mean it can be different. It can be, but

00:23:04until proven otherwise, that's what I'm going by.

00:23:08I I will say that lightning will probably exceed

00:23:12the main chain transactions. We'll have more transactions per second occurring over lightning, and that is the way that it should be.

00:23:21Now we know that, for exam,

00:23:25Coinbase, for example, hasn't even gone lightning yet. They've announced that they're going to.

00:23:31That'll be a big thing.

00:23:34They talked about how gaming has grown a lot. They've talked about

00:23:39all of these

00:23:41use cases have been growing, and and they will continue to grow, in my opinion,

00:23:45for quite a while.

00:23:47By the way, the volume the actual volume in in Bitcoin.

00:23:51In other words, the total, like, amount

00:23:54worth

00:23:54has grown as well.

00:23:57I'm trying to figure this out.

00:23:59The volume in US dollars, volume okay. So it grew from 303

00:24:04Bitcoin

00:24:05back in

00:24:07August of 2021

00:24:09to right now in August of 2023,

00:24:11almost 30,02950.

00:24:14So that's an

00:24:16874%

00:24:17growth. So not as big as

00:24:201200%,

00:24:21right, but still

00:24:23quite significant,

00:24:27quite, quite significant. And, again, this doesn't include all the private payments.

00:24:32The payment size has grown.

00:24:3425%

00:24:35is 1 to 10 sets, so that's kind of the gaming and streaming stuff, podcasting 2 point o. Another 25%

00:24:42between 10 and 1,000

00:24:45sats.

00:24:46Maybe a tip?

00:24:48Probably a tip. A 1,000 sets is only, what?

00:24:53Well, it's less than a dollar. It's like, 30¢,

00:24:56so not many purchases would be at that range. From 10,000 and upward,

00:25:03a lot of commerce remittance and node rebalancing, actually.

00:25:09So

00:25:10lightning is definitely solving a need. I think we can certainly draw that. Right?

00:25:16So they got some data here.

00:25:19The US

00:25:20is actually leading lightning usage,

00:25:23followed by my Myanmar.

00:25:25Interesting. Burma,

00:25:29Southeast Asia, the UK, Italy, Germany, France, Nigeria, Canada,

00:25:35Iran. So so far, I see 1 African country, Nigeria.

00:25:39I would have actually thought that in places

00:25:47interesting. I woulda thought that

00:25:50in places like Nigeria, Kenya,

00:25:52you know, these African countries, South America,

00:25:55these places that the lightning usage would have been a lot higher.

00:26:00That is very interesting. Alright.

00:26:03The number of nodes

00:26:05has grown

00:26:06from

00:26:07roughly

00:26:087,000

00:26:09up to,

00:26:11right now, about

00:26:1317,000.

00:26:14However,

00:26:16I'm sure they well, they do point this out. It very much reached a plateau.

00:26:21In fact, it peaked in 2022,

00:26:23and it's now dropped.

00:26:25This is a little concerning to me. Okay?

00:26:29I would love to see more lightning notes, not less. I would love to see more plebs running lightning notes, not less. And the number of channels has followed that same course. It peaked back in 2022.

McIntosh:00:26:41It's gone down

McIntosh:00:26:43about 11%, it said. The capacity has followed route as well, actually, the total Bitcoin capacity.

00:26:51So it does look like for now, we've basically reached a plateau, and I think that very much would

00:26:57pattern along with the bear market.

00:27:00We will see

00:27:02as the market starts taking off, this will go up more.

00:27:09Alright.

00:27:10I think that's pretty much it. It's a lot of good stuff.

00:27:14Even though they don't give a lot of

00:27:18emphasis to the podcasting 2.0,

00:27:22stuff,

00:27:23I see this as a very valuable part of the ecosystem,

00:27:26especially as music starts to come along, as we can stream music to,

00:27:32value for value music creators as we can boost in this kind of thing. So I think you'll see a lot of growth there over the next few years

00:27:42as well.

00:27:43I'll add my own notes here. I I do believe that lightning

00:27:47in general

McIntosh:00:27:50for a custodial a noncustodial

00:27:52setup

00:27:54needs to improve.

McIntosh:00:27:56Being able to run your own node

00:27:59or being able to somehow,

00:28:02manage your own hot wallet, that kind of thing. That's

00:28:06noncustodial.

00:28:09It's very important.

00:28:10The experience is not there yet. It is still difficult to run a note. It has improved,

00:28:16keeping channels. A lot of I talked about splicing recently, keeping channels open,

00:28:22balancing those channels, that type of thing.

00:28:25There needs to be more improvement, and there will be. We're so young. I think it's only been 5 years,

00:28:32that lightning has been around, and we're so young. We're so new to this. I don't wanna be too hard. A lot of people are there. Like, oh, we're not there yet. Blah blah blah. Lightning is dead. I'm like, yeah. You don't know what you're talking about.

00:28:46Sorry,

00:28:47not true.

00:28:48We we've plateaued as I just talked about, but we are in the middle of a bear market. And the plateau is a very high

McIntosh:00:28:56amount over the two years ago.

00:28:58So there you go.

00:29:01Alright.

McIntosh:00:29:04Let's talk about our supporters. Let's move on so that we can wrap this hop a up before it gets too late. I've been going on for 30 minutes. Thanks to my

McIntosh:00:29:14rant about Paul.

00:29:16Sorry. I just I had to get that off my chest.

McIntosh:00:29:20He'll never listen to this podcast. I don't care. I'm not gonna debate him. Its just

00:29:25stuff like that just,

00:29:27it just rubs me the wrong way.

McIntosh:00:29:30Really?

00:29:32Yep, we did get some support this week. As always, I appreciate that.

McIntosh:00:29:39Just to kinda run through the stats. I'm looking for 25,000

00:29:43sats per episode as a target.

00:29:46And the way that that works out is it comes out to about $50 a month, which is roughly what it costs to host and,

00:29:54you know, manage the infrastructure, so to speak,

00:29:57for what I'm trying to do.

00:30:00And

00:30:01put aside a little bit for, frankly, things like I need to upgrade my computer.

00:30:06And

00:30:07you'll find out

00:30:09as we as we talk about this, of course,

00:30:12that's not really the case at this point. So we're not there yet, but that's where we're heading,

00:30:20and,

00:30:21and we'll get there. And I do appreciate the people who support the show directly

00:30:26through streams, through boost as we'll talk about here in just a second.

00:30:30There are certainly other ways that you can support the show, and we'll talk about those at the end, but I've always got things

00:30:38that can help out.

00:30:41While I bring this up really, really quickly, I actually I have 2 podcasts that I deal with, one that I used to edit.

00:30:48The podcast is

00:30:50in hiatus. I don't think it'll ever come back out of hiatus, but we still host it.

00:30:55At Captivate along with the Generation Bitcoin podcast. I'm moving to a Castapod

00:31:01setup,

00:31:02and I actually moved that show because it made the most sense move it first earlier this week,

00:31:08and it went really smoothly. So I may actually before the next episode comes out, Monday,

00:31:16maybe, like, Sunday night. I may

00:31:19I may actually

00:31:22make that move,

00:31:23and will be on cast a pot, and that will open up essentially all the tags from my understanding.

00:31:31Alright. So we go back to 16th. We had some streaming.

00:31:35This was the conversation with Diego.

00:31:39Appreciate that, some good streaming.

00:31:41I do appreciate that a lot.

00:31:45And then

00:31:46with our Eric Hersman of gridless

00:31:49episode,

00:31:51Kyrin boosted a row of ducks. He said fantastic

00:31:54episode with Eric. More like this, please, thank you, sir. I do appreciate that, and that is one of my goals.

00:32:01I am trying to figure out just to be completely candid

00:32:05kinda how I do this. I love doing these interviews. I think the one with Diego went very well as well.

00:32:11It was a great conversation about somebody who's really on the front lines of what I would call hyperinflation.

00:32:17I guess, technically, it's not, but

00:32:20they're at a 138%

00:32:22or something inflation year over year.

00:32:24That's just nuts,

00:32:26and they are doing things to cope with that. I thought that was a a very good interview.

00:32:31I would love to get more of those, and I work on that as I can. I'm trying to do them every week. I'm not, as you can tell,

00:32:38but, maybe we can get there.

00:32:41So, I've got the technical stuff.

00:32:45I've got the macro stuff, and I've got the mining stuff. So I've got all these different and that does even talk about the things that I really wanna talk about,

00:32:54helping people who are unbanked. I mean, that's a whole different category, and I don't really talk about it a whole lot anymore.

McIntosh:00:33:02What about the people in Argentina who are out in the

00:33:06in the sticks.

00:33:07And there's actually a,

00:33:10there's a topic well, it goes along with, we'll talk about it in the news. I apologize,

McIntosh:00:33:16it's lightning related,

00:33:17and it

00:33:19relates to this very idea that I just put out, this banking the unbanked.

00:33:24So,

00:33:25Kyron did boost there.

00:33:27I think that might have been our only boost. We got some good streaming.

00:33:33So his was a row of ducks

00:33:35and then

00:33:385,126.

00:33:40So that is, of course, after the Satoshi tax, the Satoshi stream tax. So we're probably looking at,

00:33:47I don't know, 52.50

00:33:48or so total.

00:33:50And that's for this episode between

00:33:53the last one that I put out on Sunday and now.

00:33:57So I do appreciate that.

00:33:59I always appreciate the support we get at whatever amount.

00:34:04Let's jump on into the news.

00:34:08There's there was a bit of news, and this one thing in particular

00:34:12I wanted to talk about I post my news on Twitter. You can follow me at Macintosh Fintech

00:34:17on Twitter, and you'll kinda get it in real time.

00:34:22So

00:34:23I think this came up after the last

00:34:26episode, ironically.

00:34:30The current government in Argentina

00:34:33has abolished the income tax a week before the presidential elections. Their elections are, like, late this week

00:34:40or very early next week. I'm hoping Monday.

00:34:43We have some news about that, and I'll be honest. I mean, this is just dirty.

McIntosh:00:34:48These full these

00:34:50sorry.

00:34:51These people think that

McIntosh:00:34:54well, they're just trying to buy votes. I mean, it's very obvious. They could just turn right around and reinstate that right after the election.

00:35:01Now from the very latest data that I've seen today, it looks like this is not having any effect on people,

McIntosh:00:35:08and I hope it doesn't.

McIntosh:00:35:10And I don't know if he's the answer, Javier Millet.

00:35:15But I do know that the people who are in power there,

00:35:19it's a joke.

00:35:20The it's a wreck.

00:35:21The country's a wreck. Let's be honest.

00:35:24And they need something new. So

00:35:26maybe he's it. I don't know, and I've made that very clear.

00:35:30And I'm not I don't live in Argentina,

00:35:33so I have no dog in this hunt as they would say.

00:35:36So, anyways, on October 16th,

00:35:39I think that was Monday, that's when we got

00:35:42this report about Bitcoin, about BlackRock, about their spot ETF, and, like, you got this giant candle,

00:35:49and it's just straight up to 30,000, turn around, go right back down. But as I've said,

00:35:55the

00:35:56so it went back down to 27,000,

00:35:59less than 28,000,

00:36:00and now we're at 28,000,

00:36:02almost 800.

00:36:06New Bitcoin hash rate. Again, that's why we're seeing the increase in

00:36:11difficulty,

00:36:12440,000

00:36:14or not a 1,000. It's it's 440

McIntosh:00:36:18Exashash, I guess.

McIntosh:00:36:21By the way, a few weeks ago, I mentioned, oh, so I saw this crazy number and I reported it. It had to have been a glitch in the software. It very clearly said it was, like, 500 and something

00:36:32or 600 and something. There's no way,

00:36:36that was actually realistic. So I apologize. I try not to do things like that, but I did make a mistake. And I think even when I said it, I said this doesn't make sense, but I was just that's literally what I was seeing as I was recording. So right now, we're at roughly 440

00:36:51Exashash.

00:36:53The US

00:36:54secretary treasurer. I could not resist posting this. Janet Yellen.

00:36:59I she's our treasury secretary, so she's in charge of the money.

00:37:03America can absolutely fund afford to fund another war. Now I'm not gonna get into the politics of this, but, of course,

00:37:10we're sending money to the Ukraine. We're sending money to Israel.

00:37:15They're trying to approve another 100,000,000,000. Actually, I guess they approved it. Whatever. I don't it doesn't even matter anymore. They just print the money and send it. And she's saying, yeah, we can we can do another war. Hey. What if we open up a third one? Why don't we go ahead and open up maybe three, four?

00:37:32I'll just stop.

00:37:36Peter McCormick has posted a film

00:37:41actually about Argentina,

00:37:4345 minutes long.

00:37:45To be honest, I haven't watched it yet.

00:37:48It looks very interesting. I have not had the time. It's been a crazy week,

00:37:52but it's about the very things we were talking about on

00:37:56the

00:37:58podcast last week.

00:38:02Junk bonds now exceed top rated triple 8,

00:38:05triple a,

00:38:06excuse me,

00:38:07debt for the first time in history.

00:38:10So that goes back to the eighties.

00:38:14Spiral made a great video.

00:38:16The whole thing about the pigeons in this video is kinda stupid, but

00:38:20who is Bitcoin? It gives a great

00:38:2310 minute overview.

00:38:25It covers so many things that people think about Bitcoin that are wrong and whatever. It's a great little introduction. You should take a look at that.

00:38:37Their 1st prototype of their mining ASIC circuit board. I don't have a whole lot of hope for this, but to be honest, any competition,

00:38:45anything new in the mining space is good. We need more than, you know, a couple of Japanese companies that make cheaper stuff

00:38:53not Japanese, Chinese,

00:38:55and then

00:38:56basically overpriced American stuff. I mean, that's kinda what it is.

00:39:01Right. You got Bitmain. You've got the Whatsminer people,

00:39:05which I can never remember their actual name.

00:39:08Those are the Chinese companies and then

00:39:11and and Bitmain's the cheapest, and Bitmain's making the best equipment right now. It's inarguable

00:39:16unless they're just not reliable. We'll see.

00:39:20It's

00:39:21we need more competition.

00:39:24We need more competition,

00:39:26and we need things that

00:39:28end users can run at home, and I think that's very important.

00:39:34I don't need a machine that runs on 2 20 volt

00:39:38and sounds like a jet engine when you plug it in in my home

00:39:42and provides enough heat to heat my house because

00:39:46not that that's a terrible thing, but it's also extremely difficult to get rid of unless you, like, plummet into your heating unit, and that becomes a a really big thing.

00:39:56By the way, Janet Yellen, in an interview.

00:39:59This is the secretary treasurer.

00:40:01She literally said,

00:40:04I don't know where the 122%

00:40:07number comes from the US federal debt to GDP ratio is about 98%

00:40:13right now.

00:40:14It literally

00:40:15came from the Saint Louis Fed,

00:40:19and

00:40:20it is a 122%,

00:40:22and that's our debt to GDP.

00:40:27I'll just leave that there. I really wish they'd find somebody else.

00:40:34Bank of America

00:40:36reported

00:40:37131,000,000,000

00:40:39with a b,

00:40:40dollars of unrealized loss on securities

00:40:44in q three. So this is like t bills, treasury notes.

McIntosh:00:40:49In Q3

00:40:51they have

00:40:52unrealized. Meaning, if they sold them right now, this is how much they would be down,

00:40:58a $131,000,000,000.

McIntosh:00:41:02Alright.

00:41:02The bank industry in the United States at least is not on stable ground. And let's see.

00:41:10It is really starting to look like these

00:41:14spot ETFs are going to be approved. I think they have run out of steam. January 10th at this point would be the last day of approval,

00:41:24or outright refusal.

00:41:28So I will note that we will continue to monitor. I do believe, in my opinion,

00:41:35like I said earlier,

00:41:37especially if BlackRock gets approved, we're gonna immediately spike above 31,000,

00:41:42and then we'll see if it stays above that,

00:41:46Chinese property giant, Country Garden. So this is the second biggest one in China, I believe.

00:41:53It's Evergrande and then Country Garden. They've missed a final deadline to pay interest on a dollar bond.

00:42:00So they are going to end up going into bankruptcy, I would assume.

00:42:04There's a Wall Street Journal article about that. I'll have that in the show note.

McIntosh:00:42:09Last thing I wanted to mention.

00:42:11Yesterday,

00:42:12Lightning Labs,

00:42:15announced Taproot

00:42:17asset,

00:42:18which is

McIntosh:00:42:22they call it a protocol for assets on Bitcoin and lightning.

00:42:26So then they released it and said you can put it on the main net on the not the test net.

McIntosh:00:42:35What this allows

00:42:37is essentially stable coins

00:42:39on Bitcoin.

00:42:41And I actually think this could potentially prove to be very important.

00:42:45There's a lot of Bitcoin maximalists who say things like, you should only be working in Bitcoin.

McIntosh:00:42:52I understand where that comes from. However,

McIntosh:00:42:55I would argue, respectfully,

00:42:58these people have not been to places like

00:43:01parts of Africa

00:43:03or parts of South America

McIntosh:00:43:06where people live on less than $2 a day, US, if you convert it to US dollars,

00:43:12and or Lebanon. Any

00:43:14a lot of these places.

00:43:16They cannot

00:43:18handle

00:43:19the volatility

00:43:20of Bitcoin.

00:43:22Well, Bitcoin is going to go up. Well, yes. I agree with that.

00:43:28But if it drops 20%

00:43:30and that person can't buy the milk that they need to get through the week because of it, is that a good thing?

McIntosh:00:43:37No

00:43:39lightning

00:43:40taproot assets allows

00:43:43you to issue

McIntosh:00:43:45stable coins essentially on Bitcoin, on lightning specifically.

00:43:50So people can transact in US dollars,

00:43:54and that US dollar will be the same regardless

00:43:58of whether Bitcoin goes up or down. Is the US dollar depreciating? Is it becoming worthless?

00:44:05Absolutely,

00:44:06but at a much slower rate than, say,

00:44:09respectfully, the Argentine peso,

00:44:12which is one one of the reasons why Javier

00:44:15says that they want to switch to the US dollar.

00:44:21And as Diego pointed out, it's not pegging it to the dollar.

00:44:24If I understood

00:44:26him and recall correctly, it's actually using the US dollars. So

00:44:31that's why.

00:44:33And

00:44:35I'm not in their position, and I'm not going to tell somebody, look. You've got to you save in Bitcoin.

00:44:41You've got to keep everything in Bitcoin. You can't keep a US dollar.

00:44:45You shouldn't do that bad. Bad bit you know?

00:44:49No. If you need to keep it in Bitcoin, if you need to keep some savings in Bitcoin and some in

00:44:55some version of the US dollar, then do that. And let me provide you the tools to do that

00:45:01over the Bitcoin lightning network so that we can do things like send money instantaneously

McIntosh:00:45:06from the state of the United States to your country or vice versa

00:45:11for virtually nothing.

McIntosh:00:45:14So these things, I think, are gonna become very important. People don't realize

00:45:18how much

00:45:20of the market, for example, USDT,

00:45:23the Tether token,

00:45:24takes up. That's based on

00:45:27Ethereum.

00:45:28Why would I be pushing somebody to Ethereum if we can have that on Bitcoin?

00:45:33So I wanna point that out. It's a very important release. It's something that

00:45:38from a bankless

00:45:39perspective, again, going back to what I was talking about earlier, this is something that's very interesting to me.

00:45:45I don't understand, to be honest, exactly how that works. How do I issue

00:45:50a a dollar,

00:45:53but we know that the underlying Bitcoin can fluctuate.

00:45:57I'm looking into that. I have somewhat of an understanding, but I don't completely understand it. So maybe we talk about that

00:46:04down the road.

00:46:05Alright.

00:46:08I think that covers it. So

00:46:10we've already talked about this a little bit, so I won't harp on this too much, but Generation Bitcoin

00:46:15is a podcasting 2.0 podcast. We're a value for value podcast.

00:46:20There will never be a sponsor. Oh my goodness. I didn't even I got so sidetracked.

00:46:26That whole

00:46:28mining podcast I was listening to. They literally had to say at the front, oh, by the way,

00:46:35the people behind driving drive chain,

00:46:38the very people they were interviewing,

00:46:40paid us money,

McIntosh:00:46:44So that didn't change your viewpoint.

00:46:48I'll never have a sponsor.

McIntosh:00:46:50Paul could come to me and say, I will give you a $100,000, and I'll say

McIntosh:00:46:54no.

00:46:56It will be extremely hard,

00:46:58but I will say no.

McIntosh:00:47:00We have no advertising. You can support the podcast in three different ways, time, talent, and treasure. If you wanna support the podcast, it has a time or talent.

00:47:08There's stuff. There's stuff. Just send me a message. Okay?

00:47:11Treasure, we've already talked about.

00:47:13I appreciate immensely the people, those people who sit in those 5,000 sats this week. By the way,

00:47:20I meant to do this during support. If

00:47:22I continue to do this clips program, people are not taking me up on this. Please let me give you sats.

00:47:29If you make a clip of the 1st episode, hey. Go back and clip what I was talking about on that podcast.

00:47:37Do it, and I will post 500 sats to you, sir or ma'am.

00:47:42On an older episode,

McIntosh:00:47:44three hundred, and I'll do it right there. It'll go right into your lightning wallet. That's it. Done.

00:47:50I'll talk about that another time.

McIntosh:00:47:52If you like the content, I would love it if you tell your friends about Generation Bitcoin podcast. It is the best way to grow this podcast. Thanks for being here. I do hope this has been helpful. I know sometimes I get a little nuts,

00:48:05but it's because it's so important.

00:48:08I'm on Twitter at McIntosh Fintech. I'm on Mastodon at McIntosh podcast

00:48:13index dot social. That's it. I'm not even going through the rest. Stay humble friends. I'll talk to y'all next Monday.
