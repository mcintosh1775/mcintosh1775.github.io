In this episode, hosts McIntosh and Kenshin explore whether quantum computing poses a real threat to Bitcoin. They discuss findings from the Presidio Bitcoin Quantum Summit, where experts' concern about cryptographically relevant quantum computers arriving within 5-20 years increased after the event. However, the hosts emphasize this is not an imminent threat—current quantum computers are extremely expensive, error-prone, and nowhere near capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography. Solutions like BIP 360 are already being proposed to implement quantum-resistant algorithms when needed.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “The Jetsons” by Joe Martin.
