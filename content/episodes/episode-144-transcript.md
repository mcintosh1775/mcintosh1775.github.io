McIntosh:00:00:00Hey, SatStackers. Today is November 13th, and this is episode 144,

00:00:04generation Bitcoin. I'm your host, McIntosh. And and today's

00:00:08episode is I want my right to mix.

00:00:40Alright.

00:00:43Earl Gray, hot.

00:00:45Honey, just right.

00:00:47More roadblocks

00:00:49on the way.

00:00:50At least that's what it looks like.

00:00:55And this is not the SEC. This is not the judiciary

00:00:59system. This is

00:01:01the regulatory

00:01:02apparatus that the United States has constructed that is

00:01:07based on, in my opinion, the

00:01:09Patriot

00:01:10Act that is slowly strangling

McIntosh:00:01:12our financial system.

00:01:15What am I talking about?

00:01:18Well, we'll be talking about that during our topic.

McIntosh:00:01:21That's called a tease. I think I actually did it pretty good, but for now, we're gonna do a market before

00:01:27we jump into that topic. So

00:01:30we are at close today, just a couple of hours ago. I'm recording at 9 o'clock central time, so this was 3 hours ago.

00:01:39The close was $37,070.

00:01:44Right now, we're at 37153.

00:01:47Our block height at time of recording.

00:01:50Our difficulty adjustment, which happened earlier episode today was 3.55%

00:01:55up.

00:01:56816-555

00:01:59is our block.

00:02:02At time of recording, our difficulty adjustment,

00:02:05like I said, was up about 3%,

00:02:083 a half percent.

00:02:10There's a lot of data

00:02:12in the mempool, 1.19

00:02:13gigabytes to be exact,

00:02:17and rates are off the chain.

00:02:21They're a lot. They're very, very heavy.

00:02:25Lot of activity.

00:02:26Obviously, I think it's going back to

00:02:31these stupid ordinals,

00:02:33fine. As a minor, I make money off of it, whatever, but it's annoying. I mean, I just whatever.

00:02:39I think they'll price themselves out eventually because it's what they're paying is

00:02:44probably not.

00:02:46It's probably more than what they're worth. Just my opinion.

00:02:50Alright.

00:02:52Speaking of mining, it's been a little slow still.

00:02:56We had, like, one good day and then it's been, like, one block per day. So,

00:03:02I don't know. Kinda chug along. I think we've had,

00:03:06for the last 3 days, we've had 1 block. The 12th, we've had 1, which I was actually confirming as we speak.

00:03:13Is the 11th, 10th, 2 on the 9th, 2 on the 3 on the 8th. Yeah. That was kinda when we had that decent little run there.

McIntosh:00:03:22But that's mining.

McIntosh:00:03:25It could be six tomorrow. I could hit a new record. I think seven is my record.

McIntosh:00:03:29That would be awesome.

00:03:32Alright.

McIntosh:00:03:34So that's basically it. I you know, my general speculation is

00:03:41I don't know. For three days, we basically sat at this level.

00:03:46We seem to have reached a peak.

00:03:49I don't know. It's hard to bet for it not to go up because it's had such a good run. But I was talking to, someone today and,

00:03:57you know, it's been going up for a while now, and it's almost assuredly

00:04:01time for a pullback. Now whether that happens now or

00:04:0538,000

00:04:06or 40,000 or 41 or 42,000.

00:04:08I don't know.

00:04:10Right now, I would guess

00:04:12it's gonna pull back.

00:04:14But

00:04:15again, you know, of course, this isn't trading advice, and we never do that.

00:04:20Here at generation Bitcoin, what are we talking about? We're talking about DCA, and we're talking about dollar cost averaging every day.

00:04:27Don't worry about the price. Price goes up, you buy Bitcoin.

00:04:30Price goes down, what do we do? We buy Bitcoin. If it goes down enough,

00:04:35my suggestion would be to buy more Bitcoin. You know, if we happen to see 15, $16,000,

00:04:41I would double down on that. If it went below that, I would quadruple down if I could. That's just my

00:04:47that's what I would do. You're free to do whatever you want, of course, and that's not financial advice just to keep myself out of trouble, but,

00:04:55you know,

00:04:58that's the way I view it.

McIntosh:00:04:59So there you go.

McIntosh:00:05:01What is this topic about today? Let's just jump right on in.

00:05:07If you are involved in Bitcoin Twitter at all, you know what I'm probably going to talk about.

00:05:14Swan Bitcoin

00:05:16sent out

00:05:18an email

00:05:19of some type or some type of

00:05:22communication

00:05:23anyways

00:05:24to their end users. So Swan Bitcoin is a company that actually you can DCA through.

00:05:30They are an exchange where you can buy Bitcoin

00:05:33with Fiat from your bank account.

00:05:38As someone who is attempting to become

00:05:41self sovereign,

00:05:44what I've realized is buying Bitcoin is not hard.

McIntosh:00:05:48Buying Bitcoin anonymously,

00:05:50not really hard.

McIntosh:00:05:53Selling Bitcoin

00:05:55to fiat, on the other hand,

00:05:58is fairly

00:06:00difficult.

00:06:02Now that does tie into all this. So I I have a need because of my mining business

00:06:07to sell a small amount of Bitcoin every month into fiat, into US dollars

00:06:12for the needs of the company.

00:06:14Ep and I would love to do that anonymously, not because I'm doing anything wrong. And to be honest, I'm doing everything I can to do this

00:06:23quote correctly,

00:06:24I'm tracking everything

00:06:26and and all of this, and I will file my tax returns

00:06:30and all of that. But as a matter of

00:06:33default privacy, I would prefer that this just be anonymous,

00:06:38and that becomes very difficult. It is impossible, in fact,

00:06:42to sell Bitcoin and move it into your bank account because then your bank's going to know.

00:06:47And if it's a substantial amount, that will probably raise 14 different red flags,

00:06:53which again goes back to the regulation that we were talking about, and we're gonna get into that in just a second. But,

00:07:00anyways, so this is one of the things that is difficult. Well,

00:07:04Swan Bitcoin came out earlier today,

00:07:07this week

00:07:09with a communication, and I'm going to read. As far as I can tell, they've not denied it.

00:07:14This is legitimate.

00:07:16I don't again, I'm not a Swan customer. I did not get this directly.

00:07:21So I guess you could say, you know, this is secondhand advice,

McIntosh:00:07:26but the Swan people

00:07:29are are replying

00:07:31to this. So apparently, it's true,

00:07:34if that makes sense.

McIntosh:00:07:37So I will read what part of the communication that I have.

00:07:41It says,

00:07:42quote,

00:07:43our banking and custodial partners had made an update that could affect your account, that being your Swan account.

00:07:50In light of the recent

00:07:51proposed

00:07:52rulings from FinCEN regarding Bitcoin mixing.

00:07:56This is what we talked about a couple of episodes now.

00:08:00They will no longer service clients who directly

00:08:03interact with Bitcoin mixing services

00:08:06such as Wasabi,

00:08:08samurai and similar services. So both Wasabi and samurai

00:08:12offer a type of service called coin join that you can mix up

00:08:16your

00:08:17coins with other people

00:08:19in

00:08:21a programmatic manner,

00:08:23and it anonymizes

00:08:25your transactions,

00:08:26and this freaks the banks out.

00:08:29What this means for you that was me, by the way, not Swan. What this means for you,

00:08:35please be advised that depositing directly from

00:08:38or withdrawing directly to a mixing wallet may result in the termination of your account

00:08:44with our banking and custodial

00:08:46partners.

00:08:47To prevent any potential issues going forward, you can update your withdrawal address from your Swan dashboard.

00:08:54Ep

00:09:01that require regulated institutions

00:09:04to report mixing

00:09:06activity.

00:09:09Unfortunately, the and the rest of it's cut off.

McIntosh:00:09:12Now

McIntosh:00:09:13they've since come out and elaborated on this some.

00:09:19And if I can find that,

00:09:23I'm going to read it as well. This would be an official statement from

00:09:27the cofounder

00:09:29of Swan Bitcoin on Twitter,

00:09:32you know?

00:09:33So

00:09:34it's definitely

00:09:36legit

00:09:37if that makes sense.

00:09:38Man,

00:09:40I cannot believe I can't find this. Bummer.

00:09:43Okay. Well,

00:09:45basically, they came out and said and I will have to paraphrase this. I apologize.

00:09:51But they came out and they said, hey.

00:09:53This isn't what we want. We are having to do this to keep

00:09:58are banking services online.

00:10:02And there are a number of people in the Bitcoin ecosphere, as you can imagine, who are, like, you know, tore up about this, and they're like, well, you should have rejected this. You should have shut down your business.

00:10:14And I I understand where that's coming from.

00:10:18And if I own Swan Bitcoin,

00:10:21you know, that decision that I would have to make, I might choose to do that.

00:10:26But I also understand that, you know, their business, they have

00:10:30numerous

00:10:32employees,

00:10:33they can't you know, they're they're it would be extremely difficult to just say no.

00:10:40And what they point out is that, basically, we explicitly told you that as long as it was more than 1 hop,

00:10:49essentially,

00:10:50from Swan. It would be okay. So in other words,

00:10:54if I'm moving

00:10:56coin away from Swan, I could move it from Swan to my wallet and then from my wallet

00:11:02to

00:11:03the mixing service and then back to colds or to cold storage or whatever.

00:11:09And that would be okay in the eyes of these banks.

00:11:13And the chain analysis that they will do to ensure compliance, which is what will happen.

00:11:20So it's a tough decision.

00:11:22Now the reality is

00:11:24for now,

00:11:25many of us need

00:11:27access to Fiat just as I mentioned at the top, you know, I need to sell some Bitcoin

00:11:35from time to time to

00:11:37to get Fiat. And

00:11:39essentially, the only way that you can do that in anonymously

00:11:44and probably what I will end up doing as a matter of principle,

00:11:48epistle, I'm going to talk to people at the Bitcoin meetup, which we will not be having this month or next month, but in January,

00:11:55in saying, hey.

00:11:57I've got sats that I've mined,

00:11:59so they're, quote, clean sats. They've never been in any wallet other than the wallet that

00:12:05is attached to that account.

00:12:09And I will sell them to you at Bitcoin price or maybe even a little bit of a premium because these are clean,

00:12:17essentially,

00:12:19not traced at that point or anything like that

00:12:22for Fiat. You bringing the Fiat to the meetup, and I'll bring the lightning wallet with the

00:12:28with the sats or whatever. However we choose to do that. That is essentially the only way you do that because

00:12:34any other service let's say I went through let's say I do use RoboSats. I've talked about these different services.

00:12:41Right, if I go through Robosats, I've got the option

00:12:45to do it to Strike. I've got the option to do it to Cash App. I've got the option to do it to probably a half a dozen other services

00:12:53like that, and yet not a single one of those services

00:12:56are KYC free.

00:12:58Ep if I use Strike, they've got my personal information. If I use Cash App, they've got my personal

00:13:03information

00:13:04and so on and so forth.

00:13:07So

00:13:09we need to be realistic

00:13:11about this.

00:13:13So what could Swan have done? Well,

00:13:16the minimum that they could have done is no more than what they have done. They've told their customers

00:13:23this is happening.

00:13:25We don't have a choice in this. And by the way, if you do more than 1 hop, it doesn't matter.

00:13:32What I would like to see is for them to do things,

00:13:36and I don't know what their

00:13:38monetary position is. I I don't know anything. They're private companies as far as I know.

00:13:43I don't know anything about their books, their profit, their you know, anything like that.

00:13:49But this is going to come for all of these companies. It's going to. The banks in the United States

00:13:56are probably among the worst in the world for this type of regulation. And again, it all stems from this Patriot

00:14:04this need to monitor everything

00:14:07in ways that in my opinion as a US citizen with some understanding of the constitution and the bill of rights that this

00:14:15breaks,

00:14:17several of the amendments of the bill rights. My right to privacy, for example, that's the obvious one.

00:14:23There is an explicit right to privacy. The the

00:14:27they talk about

00:14:29your effects and your papers and this kind of thing.

00:14:33And in my opinion, this very much falls under that. It's not anybody's

00:14:38business,

00:14:40what I do

00:14:41with my money. It's not.

00:14:44Whether that's $5,

00:14:45a $1,000,

00:14:47$10,000,

00:14:48or $100,000,

00:14:50or $1,000,000.

00:14:51It's not your business

00:14:54why I have that and what I'm doing with it.

00:14:57Because

00:14:58when you

00:15:00presume

00:15:01that I'm laundering money,

00:15:05when you presume

00:15:07that I'm engaged in trafficking or drugs

00:15:10or pornography,

00:15:12child pornography, or any of these number of other things that they use as an excuse,

00:15:20you are presuming

00:15:22that I'm guilty.

00:15:24And again, by the constitution

00:15:26and bill of rights,

00:15:28that is not acceptable.

00:15:32Well, McIntosh, but there are people who traffic, and there are people who launder money, and and there are people you're presuming

00:15:40just because I'm sending somebody $10 that I'm doing something wrong.

00:15:46There's literally a regulation that says, if you reach a certain criteria and that changes from time to time, I don't know what it is right now. Ep is probably less than $10,000.

00:15:56Then, you know, we'll flag that, and we'll ask you questions. And I've

00:16:02talked about this before in passing,

00:16:05and it's frustrating. And I did a real estate transaction the last few years, and I went into the bank, and I sent money to someone else who it was their money, legitimately,

00:16:14and it was my money to send to them. And they're like, well, what are you doing? And I I

00:16:19I really wanted to scream to them,

00:16:22your ding dang business

00:16:25because it's not.

00:16:27But I knew if I did that, that the transaction would not take place.

00:16:32So they have you trapped, and then they sit there and smile at you like,

00:16:36I'm just doing my job.

00:16:39You know?

00:16:40And it's just it's frustrating

00:16:44because I know where these things go because

00:16:47this is what history has taught us,

00:16:50and we're arriving

00:16:53at that history. Well, now it's illegal for you to mix. It's not illegal,

00:16:58actually.

00:16:59Sorry.

00:17:00Words matter.

00:17:01But we're going to regulate if you can

00:17:05interact

00:17:06with these CoinJoin services.

00:17:08And if you're dealing with a bank and your coins are mixed. Well, that's a big no no

00:17:15because, gosh, those could be they could have come from North Korea.

00:17:19Oh my. They could have come from

00:17:23Palestine

00:17:24or Israel or whoever the evil person of the week is. I don't know. I can't keep up anymore. I really can't. I'm having trouble.

00:17:32It's frustrating.

00:17:34Back when I was a kid, it was just Russia.

00:17:37I mean,

00:17:38seriously,

00:17:40that's not true anymore. Now everybody's an enemy.

00:17:44Maybe they all were all along. I don't know. Ep is it Russia or is it China or is it this or is it that or you know?

McIntosh:00:17:51You're on a list.

McIntosh:00:17:53And and gosh, if we mix those coins, then we wouldn't know if they came from that list, and therefore, your your money's contaminated.

00:18:00Excuse me. Well, they don't call it money.

00:18:04I call it money.

McIntosh:00:18:05They don't they won't do that. Not yet.

00:18:08I hope the day is coming.

00:18:11So

McIntosh:00:18:14so swan's in a bad position.

00:18:16But I would say swan, if you happen to hear this,

00:18:20which you probably won't, but that's okay.

00:18:23Corey Clipson and whoever the other co Jan. Jan. That's who it was. Jan was his name. Let me

00:18:30let me see if I can find this real quick. It was John.

00:18:34Yeah. There he is.

00:18:36So this is the guy that so I I don't know. On Twitter, he goes by SKWP.

00:18:41It says, yawn,

00:18:43swan.com.

00:18:44And he posted this

00:18:47just to flesh this out.

00:18:49Here it is. November 11th. So this was yesterday.

00:18:52It was a busy weekend for them.

00:18:55Recently, we announced it sorry. I to I

00:18:59let me read this, I apologize, but I jumped squirrels ran by.

00:19:05It's the way I work.

00:19:06Let me read this, and then I will come back

00:19:09to what I would like to see them do and what I would like to see the industry do. I'll explain all that. Recently, we announced that some of the banks and qualified custodians

00:19:19that Swan works with have been freezing or terminating accounts involved in mixing Bitcoin.

00:19:25Ep okay. That was the announcement.

00:19:28Today, I'd like to help the industry get perspective on what's going on and what steps we are taking to do the right thing for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners. Now before I go further, I will applaud

00:19:40swan, and I assume that everything that they're saying here is correct,

00:19:44and they're not lying.

00:19:46I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. They are bringing this out in the open. They are not hiding it,

00:19:52and I do applaud that.

00:19:54Swan offers a variety of services from Bitcoin on ramp.

00:19:58I take my Fiat, and I buy Bitcoin with its self custody

00:20:02and collaborative custody with Swan Vault and a rapidly growing institutional arm

00:20:07that provides a variety of services

00:20:10to institutions.

00:20:12Swan does not have an anti any

00:20:16Swan does not have any anti mixing policies and continues to serve clients that mix their coins for privacy.

00:20:23In fact, we have written and published privacy guides that encourage mixing and promoted companies like Wasabi

00:20:30and Samurais

00:20:31and gave a link to something along those lines.

00:20:34We believe that mix mixing is normal,

00:20:37privacy is not a crime, and that using unmixed Bitcoin is similar to bringing your whole paycheck to the grocery store to pay for an apple. I actually think this is a really good analogy.

00:20:48You should absolutely have the right to turn that paycheck into individual dollar bills before spending it to avoid leveling the size of your paycheck.

00:20:58Sorry. To avoid revealing the size of your paycheck to the clerk, it's not the clerk's business for multiple reasons.

00:21:05Okay.

00:21:06In order to offer the Bitcoin

00:21:08on ramp component, and here's the key,

00:21:12our clients interface with

00:21:14qualified custodians

00:21:16and banks.

00:21:17Today,

00:21:18Swan works with 2 qualified custodians

00:21:21with a 3rd coming online this quarter and a 4th under our control expected to launch in 2024.

00:21:29Ep these custodians

00:21:30individually interface with multiple banking institutions

00:21:34to provide

00:21:35fiat services.

00:21:36The number of banks

00:21:38the number of banking institutions that will provide services to companies

00:21:43in our space is small and shrinking.

00:21:47The current political climate has pushed a lot of fear into the banking sector,

00:21:53with most banks

00:21:54simply refusing to do business with anything in crypto

00:21:58and other banks tightening their KYC

00:22:00AML,

00:22:02ep know your customer

00:22:03slash anti money laundering requirements

00:22:06in order to stay in business. Ep, Swan has committed the majority of its engineering and business development efforts over the last 2 years to the expansion of our footprint

00:22:16in the financial space so that we are not beholden to the whims of just a few players,

00:22:20and the launch of these new additions to our stack is a major step in that direction.

00:22:27Here's the key.

00:22:28The key of the key. I think I already said here's the key. Let's be clear.

00:22:33There's no way to process USD,

00:22:36United States dollars, in the United States if you do not use a bank or money

00:22:41services business

00:22:42and all such financial institutions

00:22:45are subject to the rules and guidelines from Finsim,

00:22:49fat

00:22:50f, I don't know how they say that, f a t f, and other unelected

00:22:54bodies, and that's the key. Even individuals performing currency exchange on peer to peer

00:23:00exchanges have been classified as MSBs

00:23:03or money service businesses

00:23:05by Finsen and are required to collect and store information about their clients,

00:23:10and several peer to peer exchanges

00:23:14have been charged with violations

00:23:16for not keeping such records.

00:23:19Today, FIs,

00:23:20that's financial institutions

00:23:22file SARs suspicious

00:23:24activity reports. This is exactly

00:23:27what I was talking about,

00:23:29which were required by the 19 seventies Bank Secrecy Act with additional guidelines enacted by the Patriot Act of 2001.

00:23:38Given the asymmetric effort it requires

00:23:41to investigate suspicious

00:23:43activities,

00:23:44the path of least resistance for banks appear to be that they file as many SARs

00:23:50suspicious

00:23:51activity reports

00:23:52as possible.

00:23:54In 2020,

00:23:55buzzfeed broke a story that showed that the SARS effectively went nowhere,

00:23:59allowing 1,000,000,000,000 of dollars of money laundering to occur in the traditional banking system,

00:24:06and these banks get nailed for this, by the way.

00:24:10They get fined. It comes out. JPMorgan, if I'm not mistaken, just recently

00:24:15got charged

00:24:16because they were allowing

00:24:18money laundering.

00:24:20These reports are filed indiscriminately

00:24:22and gratuitously

00:24:23by banks because their best option

00:24:26is to defensively file a report rather than not file it face fines.

00:24:30We believe this to be a 4th Amendment violation

00:24:33offering the government a way to provide unwarranted,

00:24:36meaning without a warrant, a

00:24:39a judge of stamped

00:24:42piece of paper saying you can go look into this person

00:24:47into their financial records.

00:24:49Search and seizure on law abiding American citizens, and that is exactly the argument that I would make, although he's doing it better than I did.

00:24:57Instead of putting a meaningful debt in any financial crimes I don't care if it does, actually.

00:25:03But,

00:25:04Anyways,

00:25:05instead of putting a meaningful debt in any financial crimes, the BSA,

00:25:10Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Acts have created honeypots

00:25:13financial data, which has been repeatedly stolen by hackers affecting hundreds of millions of Americans

00:25:20in incident such as the Equifax breach of 2017,

00:25:25the Capital One breach of 2019

00:25:27among others. Alright.

00:25:33There's a lot here.

00:25:34I will link to this in the show notes.

00:25:37I think that gives you an idea.

00:25:41I do believe

00:25:42that Swan is trying to do the right thing. I'm not arguing that at all,

00:25:46up but it is time.

00:25:48If we want Bitcoin to be what it could, can truly be

00:25:54and do what it can truly do

00:25:56and help the most people.

00:25:59We have to figure out a way to resolve this.

00:26:05A Bitcoin Maxi may give a knee jerk reaction and say, well, you can move to El Salvador.

00:26:11The reality is

00:26:13most Americans cannot do that. Not because we're not allowed, we are, but because they have family, they have jobs, they have a life here, and it is very difficult to uproot that and move. I would propose,

00:26:27we need to start fighting this, not against Swan,

00:26:31but against the US government.

00:26:33I would propose

00:26:35these are unregulated

00:26:37bodies,

00:26:38who are creating

00:26:40regulation

00:26:42because

00:26:42somebody in the White House or

00:26:45most likely or some

00:26:47special interest group tickles their ear

00:26:51and says, hey.

00:26:52We don't like this

00:26:54right up this regulation.

00:26:57As far as I can tell, it doesn't go before congress or some kind of vote. It certainly isn't voted on by the American people,

McIntosh:00:27:06and

00:27:08it violates multiple amendments

00:27:10of our constitution.

McIntosh:00:27:14So I would propose

00:27:16rather than arguing with Swan Bitcoin

00:27:18or other entities like them in the industry

00:27:22who are going to have the same problem

00:27:24that

00:27:25there has to be a,

00:27:28a foundation of some kind, a Bitcoin foundation

00:27:33that could pursue

00:27:34lawsuits.

00:27:36They I'm sure they will need money.

00:27:39As the price of Bitcoin goes up, I know some of the early adopters have

00:27:441,000,000,000 of dollars. And frankly, it would be in their financial self interest

00:27:49to start kicking into some money

00:27:53along with the plebs out here, the people like me who we didn't get in, you know, in 2011,

00:28:00and we didn't have the money to stack when

00:28:03when we did get in and so on and so forth.

00:28:08We can do what we can,

00:28:10but the reality is there's a lot of people in Bitcoin at this point who could do a lot more.

00:28:15Ep, companies like Swan should be putting in money.

00:28:18There's nothing saying that Swan couldn't kick in $100,000

00:28:23to

00:28:24a Bitcoin law foundation or whatever that would help pursue

00:28:29regulatory

00:28:31justice.

00:28:33Not sure what the right word is, but

00:28:35this bill

00:28:36is

00:28:37this bill, this regulation

00:28:39is unconstitutional.

00:28:42The Patriot Act is unconstitutional.

00:28:44Why is nobody fighting this?

00:28:47Are are do we just roll over and give up?

00:28:51I can't go out there. I don't have a law degree. I don't have the money.

00:28:55I don't have the connections,

00:28:58but there's a pretty diverse group of people in Bitcoin, and some of them

00:29:03can make this happen and start to make this work.

00:29:07And frankly, that would be far more valuable to the ecosystem

00:29:10in general

00:29:12then

00:29:13basically

00:29:14anything else that could be done.

00:29:17So let's talk about that instead of trashing Swan

00:29:20who, yes, maybe they didn't do exactly what you wanted.

00:29:24I guess they could capitulated.

00:29:29Frankly, maybe I would have if I were in their shoes. Maybe I would have said, you know what? I'm done. I'm shutting up shop, and that's it.

00:29:37But,

00:29:38you know, they've been honest with their customers in this case.

00:29:43They've been,

00:29:45thorough.

00:29:47I don't know what the

00:29:48the grief is.

00:29:50Let's point the grief at the right place. The grief is the regulatory body

00:29:55that is making unconstitutional

00:29:58regulations.

00:29:59And then let's figure out how to fix that instead of squawking on Twitter

00:30:04because maybe it gains you a few more followers

00:30:07or or whatever.

00:30:10Vitriol and

00:30:11angst, you know, we'll gain you an audience. That's for sure.

00:30:16But we need action and we need real things to go on.

00:30:20So that's my take on it. I would be curious as to what yours is.

00:30:25For those of you who are not here in the EU, your situation is essentially the same. I do not know if you have the fine,

00:30:33constitution.

00:30:35In general, I don't think you that you do. Please, if I'm being a stupid American,

00:30:41I apologize.

00:30:42Let me know.

00:30:44There has to be some form of rights or whatever, and I don't know

00:30:49if this would fall under that the same way it does for for us, it's I think it's frankly rather clear cut.

00:30:55It's astonishing

00:30:56that it's gotten to this point, but then again, a lot of things astonish me these days,

00:31:01so why not that?

00:31:04So play there's other places

00:31:07where they don't need this. I don't think Argentina's worrying about this. I mean, honestly, I I just don't think that's a problem.

00:31:14Ep El Salvador, it's certainly not an issue. But, again, I can't just up and move to El Salvador. I have responsibilities

00:31:22and,

00:31:23you know, there's reasons why that we're not gonna go into,

00:31:26and I would assure you that most Americans can't just do that.

00:31:30There are things we can vote with our feet over sometimes,

00:31:34and maybe this is 1, but I don't think enough people are gonna do that to make a difference.

00:31:40The real difference is when we're going to attack the government

00:31:45by the judiciary

00:31:47system.

00:31:50Alright.

00:31:52I think I've said enough. I will stop.

00:31:55I've been going for 37 minutes, so it must be time.

00:32:00That's kind of it, though. I do wanna get your feedback.

00:32:05This stuff is very important. I I know I say that about a lot of stuff, but

00:32:09this stuff is very important.

00:32:12Let's go on to our supporters. We did have some support this week. I do always appreciate that. We got a boost. We got some streaming.

00:32:20Kyron from Mare Mortals sent in a 222

00:32:24boost, a row of ducks.

00:32:26Two two I think I said that right. 2,222.

00:32:31Sat, so nice row of ducks and said,

00:32:34podcast guru is rock solid would highly recommend

00:32:38probably the most reliable of all the podcast 2 point o apps that enable value for value. I've been having some issues with fountain, frankly,

00:32:48because

00:32:49my old iPhone SE apparently isn't.

00:32:53I'm overloading it or

00:32:56fountain

00:32:57is using too much memory. 1 or the other. I follow 52 shows.

00:33:02I have a 1,000 episodes in my

00:33:05library, so to speak, and then I have roughly 50 right now in my queue.

00:33:11I don't know why having a bunch of markers to shows would

00:33:16consume a bunch of memory. I get the queue maybe with downloads and that kind of thing. Yes. It's taking up

00:33:22space,

00:33:24but it doesn't matter. It is what it is. They may sort it out. They may not.

00:33:30But rather than being sour about that

00:33:33because I do like fountain in general, to be honest. I they've onboarded a number of listeners for us, and,

00:33:39I mean, it's it's a great product in general, and I don't wanna be too negative about it. But I'm going to take this as an opportunity

00:33:47to test other podcast

00:33:49apps

00:33:51because,

00:33:53I'm gonna split up my load. So I've got 50 shows that I listen to at least at some point.

00:33:59I'm gonna put, you know, 10 on 1 and 10 on another and 10 on and so so on and so forth.

00:34:05That will give me yes. I'll have to switch around, but it will

00:34:09spread my load, so maybe

00:34:12my podcast app will stop crashing,

00:34:14and it will give me a real chance episode test out these other apps. I'm going to try podcast guru. I've already downloaded it actually.

00:34:23I have not hooked it up to my Alby wallet, which is how they do the value value, so I

00:34:28I haven't tested that yet, but it it is nice and quick. And I've already got my 1st show queued up on it,

00:34:35and,

00:34:36so we'll go from there.

00:34:38So thank you very much for that feedback, Karen. And as always, I appreciate the support.

00:34:45Good stuff, so thank you. Before we oh, and we had a total of sats this week,

00:34:52including streaming of

00:34:542717

00:34:55sats. So I do appreciate that support.

00:34:59Before we move on, one of the best ways to support this show is through making clips.

00:35:05If you could clip these episodes whether it's on fountain or on some other podcast app that allows you to do that, I think there's a couple, and I will be reporting on that more over the

00:35:15weeks months to come.

00:35:17But,

00:35:19if you do that and tag me or whatever,

00:35:22I will reward that 500 sets for a new episode

00:35:26for this one, which there may be some gems in there maybe,

00:35:31or 300 sats, I think it's 3.

00:35:33I may have just said that wrong. Let's go with 3.

00:35:39Three hundred for an older episode.

00:35:41Alright?

00:35:42And you get value and I get value because that helps spread the message of generation Bitcoin.

00:35:49Alright.

00:35:51The news this week is simply what we've talked about. There hasn't been anything else really in the last few days.

00:35:58Episode, I will have some links in there, certainly,

00:36:02especially

00:36:03to,

00:36:04that one

00:36:05Twitter

00:36:06post that I read in large part

00:36:09from Jan.

00:36:11There, he's cofounder of Swan. I think he and Corey Clifston

00:36:15started it.

00:36:17So it's well worth reading their position if you're interested in that. Ep there's been other episodes where I've linked to the fence in, regulation.

00:36:28It's hot garbage as I've said.

00:36:31This is really important to me as a privacy advocate,

00:36:36as someone who is interested in privacy. I believe

00:36:39that this is definite overreach of the US government, and

00:36:44I don't understand why nobody's talking about this. Surely, I'm not the smartest one out there who suddenly came up with this on my own.

00:36:51Maybe other people have, and I just haven't heard about it.

00:36:55Maybe this will generate some discussion. We will see.

00:37:00But I would really like some of these early Bitcoin people to step up and say, I'm gonna throw down, you know, a Bitcoin worth or maybe more.

00:37:09Some of these people have significant

00:37:11stashes, to be honest,

00:37:14and,

00:37:16you know, have

00:37:17wallet address where the plebs can you know, where people can send Bitcoin,

00:37:22and let's start collecting money

00:37:25that will go and there

00:37:28there needs to be some kind of foundation. There'll have to be something going. And

00:37:32I I'm not trying to figure all this out right now. I'm just saying

00:37:36there's people in this business

00:37:38who have money.

00:37:40This is super important for everyone.

00:37:43Let's put our money where our mouth is

00:37:45and start,

00:37:49pushing back.

00:37:51And you can fight the US government. You can do it. It takes money, and it takes time, but you can do it.

00:37:58Generation Bitcoin supports podcasting 2.0

00:38:01as we were just talking about. It is a value for value podcast.

00:38:05We have no sponsors. We have no advertising. And what does that mean?

00:38:09That means, dear listener,

00:38:10you are there to support this podcast,

00:38:14and I rely on

00:38:15that. People just like Kyron from earlier

00:38:18boosted 2022,

00:38:202,222

00:38:22sats, which even

00:38:24at

00:38:25$37,000 Bitcoin,

00:38:26that's less than the cup of coffee.

00:38:29And

00:38:30he is helping to support this podcast, and you can do the exact same thing.

00:38:35You can do it 3 different ways, time, talent, treasure, there's a 1,000,000,000 things I need to do, and I will be doing a lot of them in December.

00:38:44I would love to have some help,

McIntosh:00:38:46to get things prepared for our rollout

00:38:48in January.

00:38:50New name,

00:38:52new

McIntosh:00:38:53podcast platform, hopefully, things some like chapters going forward, this kind of thing. Transcripts need to be updated.

00:39:00Lots and lots of stuff. I could use help with it.

00:39:04If you have treasure in the form of sats,

00:39:07of course, I always appreciate that

00:39:10as well,

00:39:12you can use a podcasting 2.0 app.

00:39:15Something like fountain, something like podcast guru or or

00:39:19one of these

00:39:20podcast

00:39:21apps that supports value for value that allows you to do something like load up an Albie's, lightning wallet

00:39:28and stream sats or boost sats to a podcast

00:39:32and show support for that show if you appreciate what they're doing.

00:39:36If you don't know what to do, go to new podcast apps.com.

00:39:40There's a whole list of apps here. Give them a try.

00:39:43If you like the content, I would love it if you tell your friends about the generation Bitcoin

00:39:48podcast. Thanks for being here. I hope this has been helpful. I would love to hear from you. I'm on McIntosh. I'm

00:39:55I'm on Twitter at McIntosh Fintech.

00:40:13Thursday.
