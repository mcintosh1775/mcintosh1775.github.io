This week we will be performing your quarterly checkup. I hope that in these times of market confusion you are continuing to stack crypto. Daily, weekly or monthly it doesn't matter. What matters is that,  like Nike, you just do it. The saying goes .. when in doubt..zoom out!! Don't loose sight of the end goal.
