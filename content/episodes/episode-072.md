The culmination of years of work is occurring tonight with the "merge". The move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake by the Ethereum developers will shape Ethereum's future in ways that are probably not even known currently.

Join the podcast as I cover the background of the merge, the development that will be occurring after the merge and even some "live" commentary during the actually merge itself. There are events that shape the future of cryptocurrency for better or for worse and this is certainly going to be a pivotal event.
