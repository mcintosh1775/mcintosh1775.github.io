In episode 225 of "Satoshi's Plebs," hosts McIntosh and Kenshin debunk eight Bitcoin myths: that it has no intrinsic value, is mainly used by criminals, wastes energy, is too volatile for currency use, will be banned by governments, has slow/expensive transactions, will be replaced by better cryptocurrencies, and is a Ponzi scheme.

They counter each myth with evidence about Bitcoin's utility, legitimate usage (99%+ of transactions), renewable energy incentives, decreasing volatility over time, decentralized resistance to bans, Lightning Network capabilities, unique leaderless structure, and survival through multiple market cycles.

Stick around to the very end for Send It Mike's  track, “Freedom Code Revolution”.
