Join me in a great discussion with the lead of the SeedSigner Project, a DIY hardware wallet for the masses. We dive deep into the project with our  guest, @SeedSigner who brings extensive security and forensics experience and he shares the details of the wallet the project has developed.

We examine the potential risks associated with the supply chain and the personal identity associated with purchasing Bitcoin storage devices. Also, we emphasize the importance of making Bitcoin accessible to those who may not have the financial means to buy a typical hardware wallet, making this episode a must-listen for Bitcoin enthusiasts and newcomers alike.
