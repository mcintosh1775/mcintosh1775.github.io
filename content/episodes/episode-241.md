Episode 241 is a “look back to look forward” kind of conversation: Kenshin and McIntosh talk through a rough week, the grind of finishing projects, and the mental toll of doom-and-gloom news cycles—then deliberately pivot to a more optimistic, long-term lens. McIntosh also shares early progress on a new open-source side project: a Nostr-powered, end-to-end encrypted “email-like” messaging concept that adds tiny Satoshi payments to discourage spam and compensate the servers relaying/storing messages.

From there, the episode zooms out into Bitcoin perspective. Using their own episode archive as a timeline, they revisit key moments from 2021–2022 to underline the core message: ignore the panic, keep a low time preference, and DCA—especially when sentiment is bleak. They close with the usual metrics (price, market caps, hash rate/difficulty notes, halving countdown), a listener boost, and a reminder to support the show via value-for-value and reviews.
