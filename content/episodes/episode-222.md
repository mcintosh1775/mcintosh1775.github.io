Kenshin and McIntosh discuss a key bullish signal from Coinbase where institutional trading volumes have reached 75% of total activity. According to research from Charles Edwards at Caprio Investments, this metric has historically predicted Bitcoin price increases within seven days every time it occurs. The pattern previously triggered significant price movements.

Institutions are currently buying approximately 600% more Bitcoin than the daily mining production, creating massive supply pressure. Companies like MicroStrategy continue their regular Bitcoin purchases, while new Bitcoin treasury companies are emerging globally. The hosts believe this institutional demand, combined with ETF inflows and the upcoming retail FOMO phase, sets up a perfect storm for Bitcoin's next major price movement.

Stick around to the very end for the V4V track, “Horizons of Hope” by Jawbone.
