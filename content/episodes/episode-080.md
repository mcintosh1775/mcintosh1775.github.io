This week's news has Twitter all riled up. And it wasn't just about Elon's taking over. It seems that the [FTX Exchange](https://ftx.us/) of Sam Bankman-Fried may be a little too cozy with [Alameda Research](https://www.alameda-research.com/). And [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) will be selling all their FTT tokens.. Is this all related? Will it crash the market? Does it matter?
