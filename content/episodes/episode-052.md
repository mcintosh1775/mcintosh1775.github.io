In my opinion, one of the most important events of the year will be taking place with the Ethereum 2.0 "merge". The process that will bring together the beacon chain and the main net will create a true deflationary token. It will also be moving from proof of work to proof stake.

There are benefits to this this merge that should greatly increase the value of Ethereum in the future.
