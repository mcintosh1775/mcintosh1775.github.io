Tuesday and Wednesday of this week the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meets to "guide" the monetary policy of the United States. I believe this will help determine both the near term economic climate as well as affect crypto assets in both the short and long term.  Don't dismiss this as idle political speculation. I stay as far from the politics as possible. The decisions reached by this committee of twelve will have a great deal of influence on your financial life. You need to understand what this is all about.

I can be reached by email at [mcintosh@genwealthcrytpo.com](mailto:mcintosh@genwealthcrytpo.com) and on twitter at @McIntoshFinTech. Looking forward to hearing from you!
