May the 22nd is "bitcoin pizza day". It should be a day we celebrate by spending bitcoin to purchase goods and services -- instead many times it's a joke about the poor guy who spent 10,000 bitcoin on a couple of Pappa John's pizza.

While bitcoin has become a store of value, it was created as digital currency. And the good news is that it can be both!! And using it for both will only accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin - and ultimately increase the price. So celebrate!
