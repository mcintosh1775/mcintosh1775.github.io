This week McIntosh and Kenshin tackle the part of Bitcoin everyone thinks they understand… right up until a transaction gets stuck: fees, mempool dynamics, and UTXO hygiene. They frame fees as a live market for scarce blockspace, explain what you’re actually paying for (sats/vbyte), and show how transaction “weight” changes based on inputs/outputs—why a “cheap” fee rate can still be expensive if your transaction is big.

They also cover the two practical “escape hatches” when things go sideways—RBF (Replace-By-Fee) and CPFP (Child Pays For Parent)—plus why wallet fee estimators can be misleading and why mempool visibility matters. Finally, they get into UTXO management: why too many small UTXOs (“dust”) can become unspendable in high-fee environments, and why low-fee periods are the time to consolidate, not when you’re already in a firefight.
