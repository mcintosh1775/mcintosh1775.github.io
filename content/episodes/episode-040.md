Our very first interview!!! Today I welcomed our very first guest to the show. I met Gary on the podcastindex.social mastodon instance where I post as @macintosh@podcastindex.social. I had posted about todays news and he and I began a conversation. As a world traveler (many times over) he has a great perspective on what bitcoin adoption can bring to emerging countries.

We talk about lightning network adoption as well as nations using bitcoin as legal tender. Hope you enjoy the discussion!
